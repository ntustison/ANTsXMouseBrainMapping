	abstract = {Multimodal microstructural MRI has shown increased sensitivity and specificity to changes in various brain disease and injury models in the preclinical setting. Here, we present an in vivo longitudinal dataset, including a subset of ex vivo data, acquired as control data and to investigate microstructural changes in the healthy mouse brain. The dataset consists of structural T2-weighted imaging, magnetization transfer ratio and saturation imaging, and advanced quantitative diffusion MRI (dMRI) methods. The dMRI methods include oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) dMRI and microscopic anisotropy (μA) dMRI, which provide additional insight by increasing sensitivity to smaller spatial scales and disentangling fiber orientation dispersion from true microstructural changes, respectively. The technical skills required to analyze microstructural MRI data are complex and include MRI sequence development, acquisition, and computational neuroimaging expertise. Here, we share unprocessed and preprocessed data, and scalar maps of quantitative MRI metrics. We envision utility of this dataset in the microstructural MRI field to develop and test biophysical models, methods that model temporal brain dynamics, and registration and preprocessing pipelines.},

@article{Tustison:2019aa,
	abstract = {Longitudinal studies of development and disease in the human brain have motivated the acquisition of large neuroimaging data sets and the concomitant development of robust methodological and statistical tools for quantifying neurostructural changes. Longitudinal-specific strategies for acquisition and processing have potentially significant benefits including more consistent estimates of intra-subject measurements while retaining predictive power. Using the first phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) data, comprising over 600 subjects with multiple time points from baseline to 36 months, we evaluate the utility of longitudinal FreeSurfer and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) surrogate thickness values in the context of a linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling strategy. Specifically, we estimate the residual variability and between-subject variability associated with each processing stream as it is known from the statistical literature that minimizing the former while simultaneously maximizing the latter leads to greater scientific interpretability in terms of tighter confidence intervals in calculated mean trends, smaller prediction intervals, and narrower confidence intervals for determining cross-sectional effects. This strategy is evaluated over the entire cortex, as defined by the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol, where comparisons are made with the cross-sectional and longitudinal FreeSurfer processing streams. Subsequent linear mixed effects modeling for identifying diagnostic groupings within the ADNI cohort is provided as supporting evidence for the utility of the proposed ANTs longitudinal framework which provides unbiased structural neuroimage processing and competitive to superior power for longitudinal structural change detection.},

	abstract = {Establishing correspondences across brains for the purposes of comparison and group analysis is almost universally done by registering images to one another either directly or via a template. However, there are many registration algorithms to choose from. A recent evaluation of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods, as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than 16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels, registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following: 1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration; and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods using present resampling methods. From the results of this study, we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

@article{Klein:2009aa,
	abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

Several leading research and engineering groups participated in this effort that was funded by the US National Institutes of Health through a variety of infrastructure grants. This effort transformed 3D Slicer from an internal, Boston-based, academic research software application into a professionally maintained, robust, open source platform with an international leadership and developer and user communities. Critical improvements to the widely used underlying open source libraries and tools-VTK, ITK, CMake, CDash, DCMTK-were an additional consequence of this effort. This project has contributed to close to a thousand peer-reviewed publications and a growing portfolio of US and international funded efforts expanding the use of these tools in new medical computing applications every year. In this editorial, we discuss what we believe are gaps in the way medical image computing is pursued today; how a well-executed research platform can enable discovery, innovation and reproducible science ("Open Science"); and how our quest to build such a software platform has evolved into a productive and rewarding social engineering exercise in building an open-access community with a shared vision.},

	abstract = {Reproducibility verification is essential to the practice of the scientific method. Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature. Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification. This article describes the multiple tools, methodologies, and practices that the ITK community has adopted, refined, and followed during the past decade, in order to become one of the research communities with the most modern reproducibility verification infrastructure. For example, 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84% code line test coverage. The Insight Journal, an open publication journal associated with the toolkit, has seen over 360,000 publication downloads. The median normalized closeness centrality, a measure of knowledge flow, resulting from the distributed peer code review system was high, 0.46.},

Parameterized reconstruction methods employing B-splines have typically utilized least-squares methodology for data fitting. For large sample sets, solving the resulting linear system is computationally demanding as well as susceptible to ill-conditioning. We present a generalization of a previously proposed fast surface fitting technique for cubic B-splines which avoids the pitfalls of the conventional fitting approach. Our proposed generalization consists of expanding the algorithm to n dimensions, allowing for arbitrary spline degree in the different parametric dimensions, permitting wrapping of the parametric domain, and the assignment of confidence values to the data points for more precise control over the fitting results. In addition, we implement our generalized B-spline approximation algorithm within the Insight Toolkit (ITK) for open source dissemination.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To adapt the so-called nonlocal means filter to deal with magnetic resonance (MR) images with spatially varying noise levels (for both Gaussian and Rician distributed noise).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Most filtering techniques assume an equal noise distribution across the image. When this assumption is not met, the resulting filtering becomes suboptimal. This is the case of MR images with spatially varying noise levels, such as those obtained by parallel imaging (sensitivity-encoded), intensity inhomogeneity-corrected images, or surface coil-based acquisitions. We propose a new method where information regarding the local image noise level is used to adjust the amount of denoising strength of the filter. Such information is automatically obtained from the images using a new local noise estimation method.
RESULTS: The proposed method was validated and compared with the standard nonlocal means filter on simulated and real MRI data showing an improved performance in all cases.
CONCLUSION: The new noise-adaptive method was demonstrated to outperform the standard filter when spatially varying noise is present in the images.},

	abstract = {One of the major drawbacks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the lack of a standard and quantifiable interpretation of image intensities. Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. We have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a way that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.},

Smoothness is guaranteed without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods, such as those based on linearized elasticity or thin-plate splines, in that stress restraining the motion relaxes over time allowing large-magnitude deformations. Kinematic nonlinearities are inherently necessary to maintain continuity of structures during large-magnitude deformations, and are included in all results. After initial global registration, final mappings are obtained by numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations associated with the constrained optimization problem. Automatic regridding is performed by propagating templates as the nonlinear transformations evaluated on a finite lattice become singular. Application of the method to intersubject registration of neuroanatomical structures illustrates the ability to account for local anatomical variability.},

	abstract = {This paper presents two different mathematical methods that can be used separately or in conjunction to accommodate shape variabilities between normal human neuroanatomies. Both methods use a digitized textbook to represent the complex structure of a typical normal neuroanatomy. Probabilistic transformations on the textbook coordinate system are defined to accommodate shape differences between the textbook and images of other normal neuroanatomies. The transformations are constrained to be consistent with the physical properties of deformable elastic solids in the first method and those of viscous fluids in the second. Results presented in this paper demonstrate how a single deformable textbook can be used to accommodate normal shape variability.},

However, unlike the adult mouse brain, the lack of standard 3D reference atlases for developing mouse brains has hindered advancement of our understanding of brain development. Here, we present a multimodal 3D developmental common coordinate framework (DevCCF) spanning mouse embryonic day (E) 11.5, E13.5, E15.5, E18.5, and postnatal day (P) 4, P14, and P56 with anatomical segmentations defined by a developmental ontology. At each age, the DevCCF features undistorted morphologically averaged atlas templates created from Magnetic Resonance Imaging and co-registered high-resolution templates from light sheet fluorescence microscopy. Expert-curated 3D anatomical segmentations at each age adhere to an updated prosomeric model and can be explored via an interactive 3D web-visualizer. As a use case, we employed the DevCCF to unveil the emergence of GABAergic neurons in embryonic brains. Moreover, we integrated the Allen CCFv3 into the P56 template with stereotaxic coordinates and mapped spatial transcriptome cell-type data with the developmental ontology. In summary, the DevCCF is an openly accessible resource that can be used for large-scale data integration to gain a comprehensive understanding of brain development.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key technology in multimodal animal studies of brain connectivity and disease pathology. In vivo MRI provides non-invasive, whole brain macroscopic images containing structural and functional information, thereby complementing invasive in vivo high-resolution microscopy and ex vivo molecular techniques. Brain mapping, the correlation of corresponding regions between multiple brains in a standard brain atlas system, is widely used in human MRI. For small animal MRI, however, there is no scientific consensus on pre-processing strategies and atlas-based neuroinformatics. Thus, it remains difficult to compare and validate results from different pre-clinical studies which were processed using custom-made code or individual adjustments of clinical MRI software and without a standard brain reference atlas. Here, we describe AIDAmri, a novel Atlas-based Imaging Data Analysis pipeline to process structural and functional mouse brain data including anatomical MRI, fiber tracking using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional connectivity analysis using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). The AIDAmri pipeline includes automated pre-processing steps, such as raw data conversion, skull-stripping and bias-field correction as well as image registration with the Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas (ARA). Following a modular structure developed in Python scripting language, the pipeline integrates established and newly developed algorithms. Each processing step was optimized for efficient data processing requiring minimal user-input and user programming skills. The raw data is analyzed and results transferred to the ARA coordinate system in order to allow an efficient and highly-accurate region-based analysis. AIDAmri is intended to fill the gap of a missing open-access and cross-platform toolbox for the most relevant mouse brain MRI sequences thereby facilitating data processing in large cohorts and multi-center studies.},

	abstract = {Anatomical segmentation of structures of interest is critical to quantitative analysis in medical imaging. Several automated multi-atlas based segmentation propagation methods that utilise manual delineations from multiple templates appear promising. However, high levels of accuracy and reliability are needed for use in diagnosis or in clinical trials. We propose a new local ranking strategy for template selection based on the locally normalised cross correlation (LNCC) and an extension to the classical STAPLE algorithm by Warfield et al. (2004), which we refer to as STEPS for Similarity and Truth Estimation for Propagated Segmentations. It addresses the well-known problems of local vs. global image matching and the bias introduced in the performance estimation due to structure size. We assessed the method on hippocampal segmentation using a leave-one-out cross validation with optimised model parameters; STEPS achieved a mean Dice score of 0.925 when compared with manual segmentation. This was significantly better in terms of segmentation accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art fusion techniques. Furthermore, due to the finer anatomical scale, STEPS also obtains more accurate segmentations even when using only a third of the templates, reducing the dependence on large template databases. Using a subset of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) scans from different MRI imaging systems and protocols, STEPS yielded similarly accurate segmentations (Dice=0.903). A cross-sectional and longitudinal hippocampal volumetric study was performed on the ADNI database. Mean$\pm$SD hippocampal volume (mm(3)) was 5195 $\pm$ 656 for controls; 4786 $\pm$ 781 for MCI; and 4427 $\pm$ 903 for Alzheimer's disease patients and hippocampal atrophy rates (%/year) of 1.09 $\pm$ 3.0, 2.74 $\pm$ 3.5 and 4.04 $\pm$ 3.6 respectively. Statistically significant (p<10(-3)) differences were found between disease groups for both hippocampal volume and volume change rates. Finally, STEPS was also applied in a multi-label segmentation propagation scenario using a leave-one-out cross validation, in order to parcellate 83 separate structures of the brain. Comparisons of STEPS with state-of-the-art multi-label fusion algorithms showed statistically significant segmentation accuracy improvements (p<10(-4)) in several key structures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-field MRI is a popular technique for the study of rodent brains. These datasets, while similar to human brain MRI in many aspects, present unique image processing challenges. We address a very common preprocessing step, skull-stripping, which refers to the segmentation of the brain tissue from the image for further processing. While several methods exist for addressing this problem, they are computationally expensive and often require interactive post-processing by an expert to clean up poorly segmented areas. This further increases total processing time per subject.
NEW METHOD: We propose a novel algorithm, based on grayscale mathematical morphology and LOGISMOS-based graph segmentation, which is rapid, robust and highly accurate.
RESULTS: Comparative results obtained on two challenging in vivo datasets, consisting of 22 T1-weighted rat brain images and 10 T2-weighted mouse brain images illustrate the robustness and excellent performance of the proposed algorithm, in a fraction of the computational time needed by existing algorithms.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: In comparison to current state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92 $\pm$ 0.02 and average Hausdorff distance of 13.6 $\pm$ 5.2 voxels (vs. 0.85 $\pm$ 0.20, p<0.05 and 42.6 $\pm$ 22.9, p << 0.001) for the rat dataset, and 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01 and average Hausdorff distance of 21.6 $\pm$ 12.7 voxels (vs. 0.93 $\pm$ 0.01, p <<0.001 and 33.7 $\pm$ 3.5, p <<0.001) for the mouse dataset. The proposed algorithm took approximately 90s per subject, compared to 10-20 min for the neural-network based method and 30-90 min for the atlas-based method.
CONCLUSIONS: RATS is a robust and computationally efficient method for accurate rodent brain skull-stripping even in challenging data.},

	abstract = {Based on the Fourier transform relation between diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) signals and the underlying diffusion displacement, a new relation is derived to estimate the spin distribution function (SDF) directly from diffusion MR signals. This relation leads to an imaging method called generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), which can obtain the SDF from the shell sampling scheme used in q-ball imaging (QBI) or the grid sampling scheme used in diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). The accuracy of GQI was evaluated by a simulation study and an in vivo experiment in comparison with QBI and DSI. The simulation results showed that the accuracy of GQI was comparable to that of QBI and DSI. The simulation study of GQI also showed that an anisotropy index, named quantitative anisotropy, was correlated with the volume fraction of the resolved fiber component. The in vivo images of GQI demonstrated that SDF patterns were similar to the ODFs reconstructed by QBI or DSI. The tractography generated from GQI was also similar to those generated from QBI and DSI. In conclusion, the proposed GQI method can be applied to grid or shell sampling schemes and can provide directional and quantitative information about the crossing fibers.},

	abstract = {Cerebral atrophy is one of the most widely brain alterations associated to aging. A clear relationship has been established between age-associated cognitive impairments and cerebral atrophy. The mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a small primate used as a model of age-related neurodegenerative processes. It is the first non-human primate in which cerebral atrophy has been correlated with cognitive deficits. Previous studies of cerebral atrophy in this model were based on time consuming manual delineation or measurement of selected brain regions from magnetic resonance images (MRI). These measures could not be used to analyse regions that cannot be easily outlined such as the nucleus basalis of Meynert or the subiculum. In humans, morphometric assessment of structural changes with age is generally performed with automated procedures such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The objective of our work was to perform user-independent assessment of age-related morphological changes in the whole brain of large mouse lemur populations thanks to VBM. The study was based on the SPMMouse toolbox of SPM 8 and involved thirty mouse lemurs aged from 1.9 to 11.3 years. The automatic method revealed for the first time atrophy in regions where manual delineation is prohibitive (nucleus basalis of Meynert, subiculum, prepiriform cortex, Brodmann areas 13-16, hypothalamus, putamen, thalamus, corpus callosum). Some of these regions are described as particularly sensitive to age-associated alterations in humans. The method revealed also age-associated atrophy in cortical regions (cingulate, occipital, parietal), nucleus septalis, and the caudate. Manual measures performed in some of these regions were in good agreement with results from automatic measures. The templates generated in this study as well as the toolbox for SPM8 can be downloaded. These tools will be valuable for future evaluation of various treatments that are tested to modulate cerebral aging in lemurs.},

A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications.

The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue clearing is currently revolutionizing neuroanatomy by enabling organ-level imaging with cellular resolution. However, currently available tools for data analysis require a significant time investment for training and adaptation to each laboratory's use case, which limits productivity. Here, we present FriendlyClearMap, an integrated toolset that makes ClearMap1 and ClearMap2's CellMap pipeline easier to use, extends its functions, and provides Docker Images from which it can be run with minimal time investment. We also provide detailed tutorials for each step of the pipeline.
FINDINGS: For more precise alignment, we add a landmark-based atlas registration to ClearMap's functions as well as include young mouse reference atlases for developmental studies. We provide an alternative cell segmentation method besides ClearMap's threshold-based approach: Ilastik's Pixel Classification, importing segmentations from commercial image analysis packages and even manual annotations. Finally, we integrate BrainRender, a recently released visualization tool for advanced 3-dimensional visualization of the annotated cells.
CONCLUSIONS: As a proof of principle, we use FriendlyClearMap to quantify the distribution of the 3 main GABAergic interneuron subclasses (parvalbumin+ [PV+], somatostatin+, and vasoactive intestinal peptide+) in the mouse forebrain and midbrain.

	abstract = {Brain volume measurements extracted from structural MRI data sets are a widely accepted neuroimaging biomarker to study mouse models of neurodegeneration. Whether to acquire and analyze data in vivo or ex vivo is a crucial decision during the phase of experimental designs, as well as data analysis. In this work, we extracted the brain structures for both longitudinal in vivo and single-time-point ex vivo MRI acquired from the same animals using accurate automatic multi-atlas structural parcellation, and compared the corresponding statistical and classification analysis. We found that most gray matter structures volumes decrease from in vivo to ex vivo, while most white matter structures volume increase. The level of structural volume change also varies between different genetic strains and treatment. In addition, we showed superior statistical and classification power of ex vivo data compared to the in vivo data, even after resampled to the same level of resolution. We further demonstrated that the classification power of the in vivo data can be improved by incorporating longitudinal information, which is not possible for ex vivo data. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the tissue-specific changes, as well as the difference in statistical and classification power, between the volumetric analysis based on the in vivo and ex vivo structural MRI data. Our results emphasize the importance of longitudinal analysis for in vivo data analysis.},

We develop an automated resource that combines histologically cleared volumes with connectivity atlases and MRI, enabling the analysis of histological features across multiple fiber tracts and networks, and their correlation with in-vivo biomarkers. We apply our pipeline in a murine stroke model, demonstrating not only strong correspondence between MRI abnormalities and CLARITY-tissue staining, but also uncovering acute cellular effects in areas connected to the ischemic core. We provide improved maps of connectivity by quantifying projection terminals from CLARITY viral injections, and integrate diffusion MRI with CLARITY viral tracing to compare connectivity maps across scales. Finally, we demonstrate tract-level histological changes of stroke through this multimodal integration. This resource can propel investigations of network alterations underlying neurological disorders.},

We have developed a digital atlas of the adult C57BL/6J mouse brain as a comprehensive framework for storing and accessing the myriad types of information about the mouse brain.

Along with raw and annotated images, it contains database management systems and a set of tools for comparing information from different techniques. The framework allows facile correlation of results from different animals, investigators or laboratories by establishing a canonical representation of the mouse brain and providing the tools for the insertion of independent data into the same space as the atlas. This tool will aid in managing the increasingly complex and voluminous amounts of information about the mammalian brain. It provides a framework that encompasses genetic information in the context of anatomical imaging and holds tremendous promise for producing new insights into the relationship between genotype and phenotype. We describe a suite of tools that enables the independent entry of other types of data, facile retrieval of information and straightforward display of images. Thus, the atlas becomes a framework for managing complex genetic and epigenetic information about the mouse brain. The atlas and associated tools may be accessed at http://www.loni.ucla.edu/MAP.},

	abstract = {The reliability of scientific results critically depends on reproducible and transparent data processing. Cross-subject and cross-study comparability of imaging data in general, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in particular, is contingent on the quality of registration to a standard reference space. In small animal MRI this is not adequately provided by currently used processing workflows, which utilize high-level scripts optimized for human data, and adapt animal data to fit the scripts, rather than vice-versa. In this fully reproducible article we showcase a generic workflow optimized for the mouse brain, alongside a standard reference space suited to harmonize data between analysis and operation. We introduce four separate metrics for automated quality control (QC), and a visualization method to aid operator inspection. Benchmarking this workflow against common legacy practices reveals that it performs more consistently, better preserves variance across subjects while minimizing variance across sessions, and improves both volume and smoothness conservation RMSE approximately 2-fold. We propose this open source workflow and the QC metrics as a new standard for small animal MRI registration, ensuring workflow robustness, data comparability, and region assignment validity, all of which are indispensable prerequisites for the comparability of scientific results across experiments and centers.},

Registration of these multi-dimensional whole-brain images onto a standard atlas is essential for characterizing neuron types and constructing brain wiring diagrams. However, cross-modal image registration is challenging due to intrinsic variations of brain anatomy and artifacts resulting from different sample preparation methods and imaging modalities. We introduce a cross-modal registration method, mBrainAligner, which uses coherent landmark mapping and deep neural networks to align whole mouse brain images to the standard Allen Common Coordinate Framework atlas. We build a brain atlas for the fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography modality to facilitate single-cell mapping, and used our method to generate a whole-brain map of three-dimensional single-neuron morphology and neuron cell types.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive knowledge of the brain's wiring diagram is fundamental for understanding how the nervous system processes information at both local and global scales. However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.},

While validation standards are necessarily high and routinely met in the clinical arena, they have to date been lacking for high-resolution microscopy data sets obtained from the rodent brain. Here we present a tool for optimized automated mouse atlas propagation (aMAP) based on clinical registration software (NiftyReg) for anatomical segmentation of high-resolution 3D fluorescence images of the adult mouse brain. We empirically evaluate aMAP as a method for registration and subsequent segmentation by validating it against the performance of expert human raters.

	abstract = {Accurately mapping brain structures in three-dimensions is critical for an in-depth understanding of brain functions. Using the brain atlas as a hub, mapping detected datasets into a standard brain space enables efficient use of various datasets. However, because of the heterogeneous and nonuniform brain structure characteristics at the cellular level introduced by recently developed high-resolution whole-brain microscopy techniques, it is difficult to apply a single standard to robust registration of various large-volume datasets. In this study, we propose a robust Brain Spatial Mapping Interface (BrainsMapi) to address the registration of large-volume datasets by introducing extracted anatomically invariant regional features and a large-volume data transformation method. By performing validation on model data and biological images, BrainsMapi achieves accurate registration on intramodal, individual, and multimodality datasets and can also complete the registration of large-volume datasets (approximately 20 TB) within 1 day. In addition, it can register and integrate unregistered vectorized datasets into a common brain space. BrainsMapi will facilitate the comparison, reuse and integration of a variety of brain datasets.},

Remarkable advances in neuroscience techniques enable labeling and imaging of these individual cell types and their interactions throughout intact mammalian brains at a cellular resolution allowing neuroscientists to examine microscopic details in macroscopic brain circuits. Nevertheless, implementing these tools is fraught with many technical and analytical challenges with a need for high-level data analysis. Here we review key technical considerations for implementing a brain mapping pipeline using the mouse brain as a primary model system. Specifically, we provide practical details for choosing methods including cell type specific labeling, sample preparation (e.g., tissue clearing), microscopy modalities, image processing, and data analysis (e.g., image registration to standard atlases). We also highlight the need to develop better 3D atlases with standardized anatomical labels and nomenclature across species and developmental time points to extend the mapping to other species including humans and to facilitate data sharing, confederation, and integrative analysis. In summary, this review provides key elements and currently available resources to consider while developing and implementing high-resolution mapping methods.},

The ability of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of complex tissues has therefore been particularly powerful in the nervous system. Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions1-8, the whole adult brain9 and even entire embryos10. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system.},

Multiple single slice histology sections can no longer provide sufficient detail of inter-slice microstructure and lack out of plane resolution. Two ex vivo methods have emerged that can create such detailed models. High-field micro MRI with the addition of contrast media has allowed intact whole brain microstructure imaging with an isotropic resolution of 15 μm in mouse. Blockface imaging has similarly evolved to a point where it is now possible to image an entire brain in a rigorous fashion with an out of plane resolution of 10 μm. Despite the destruction of the tissue as part of this process it allows a reconstructed model that is free from cutting artifacts. Both of these methods have been utilised to create minimum deformation atlases that are representative of the respective populations. The MDA atlases allow us unprecedented insight into the commonality and differences in microstructure in cortical structures in specific taxa.

Accurate registration of sample brains to a common anatomic reference is critical for precise assignment of IEG-positive ("active") neurons to known brain regions of interest (ROIs). While existing automated voxel-based registration methods provide a high-throughput solution, they require substantial computing power, can be difficult to implement and fail when brains are damaged or only partially imaged. Additionally, it is challenging to cross-validate these approaches or compare them to any preexisting literature based on serial coronal sectioning. Here, we present the open-source R package SMART (Semi-Manual Alignment to Reference Templates) that extends the WholeBrain R package framework to automated segmentation and semi-automated registration of intact mouse brain light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) datasets. The SMART package was created for novice programmers and introduces a streamlined pipeline for aligning, registering, and segmenting LSFM volumetric datasets across the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, using a simple "choice game" and interactive menus. SMART provides the flexibility to register whole brains, partial brains or discrete user-chosen images, and is fully compatible with traditional sectioned coronal slice-based analyses. We demonstrate SMART's core functions using example datasets and provide step-by-step video tutorials for installation and implementation of the package. We also present a modified iDISCO+ tissue clearing procedure for uniform immunohistochemical labeling of the activity marker Fos across intact mouse brains. The SMART pipeline, in conjunction with the modified iDISCO+ Fos procedure, is ideally suited for examination and orthogonal cross-validation of brain-wide neuronal activation datasets.},

	abstract = {Revealing neural circuit mechanisms is critical for understanding brain functions. Significant progress in dissecting neural connections has been made using optical imaging with fluorescence labels, especially in dissecting local connections. However, acquiring and tracing brain-wide, long-distance neural circuits at the neurite level remains a substantial challenge. Here, we describe a whole-brain approach to systematically obtaining continuous neuronal pathways in a fluorescent protein transgenic mouse at a one-micron voxel resolution. This goal is achieved by combining a novel resin-embedding method for maintaining fluorescence, an automated fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography system for long-term stable imaging, and a digital reconstruction-registration-annotation pipeline for tracing the axonal pathways in the mouse brain. With the unprecedented ability to image a whole mouse brain at a one-micron voxel resolution, the long-distance pathways were traced minutely and without interruption for the first time. With advancing labeling techniques, our method is believed to open an avenue to exploring both local and long-distance neural circuits that are related to brain functions and brain diseases down to the neurite level.},

New methods now enable large-scale mapping of the mouse brain at cellular and subcellular resolution. We developed a framework to automatically annotate, analyze, visualize and easily share whole-brain data at cellular resolution, based on a scale-invariant, interactive mouse brain atlas. This framework enables connectivity and mapping projects in individual laboratories and across imaging platforms, as well as multiplexed quantitative information on the molecular identity of single neurons. As a proof of concept, we generated a comparative connectivity map of five major neuron types in the corticostriatal circuit, as well as an activity-based map to identify hubs mediating the behavioral effects of cocaine. Thus, this computational framework provides the necessary tools to generate brain maps that integrate data from connectivity, neuron identity and function.},

A diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness (DiReCT) measure is introduced where a continuous one-to-one correspondence between the gray matter-white matter interface and the estimated gray matter-cerebrospinal fluid interface is given by a diffeomorphic mapping in the image space. Thickness is then defined in terms of a distance measure between the interfaces of this sheet like structure. This technique also provides a natural way to compute continuous estimates of thickness within buried sulci by preventing opposing gray matter banks from intersecting. In addition, the proposed method incorporates neuroanatomical constraints on thickness values as part of the mapping process. Evaluation of this method is presented on synthetic images. As an application to brain images, a longitudinal study of thickness change in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorder is reported.},

	abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

	abstract = {Segmenting and quantifying gliomas from MRI is an important task for diagnosis, planning intervention, and for tracking tumor changes over time. However, this task is complicated by the lack of prior knowledge concerning tumor location, spatial extent, shape, possible displacement of normal tissue, and intensity signature. To accommodate such complications, we introduce a framework for supervised segmentation based on multiple modality intensity, geometry, and asymmetry feature sets. These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate excellent discriminative properties within this framework. We also gain performance by generating probability maps from random forest models and using these maps for a refining Markov random field regularized probabilistic segmentation. This strategy allows us to interface the supervised learning capabilities of the random forest model with regularized probabilistic segmentation using the recently developed ANTsR package--a comprehensive statistical and visualization interface between the popular Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the R statistical project. The reported algorithmic framework was the top-performing entry in the MICCAI 2013 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge. The challenge data were widely varying consisting of both high-grade and low-grade glioma tumor four-modality MRI from five different institutions. Average Dice overlap measures for the final algorithmic assessment were 0.87, 0.78, and 0.74 for "complete", "core", and "enhanced" tumor components, respectively.},

Prior information in the form of regularization is used to enforce transform plausibility taking the form of physics-based constraints or through some approximation thereof, e.g., Gaussian smoothing of the vector fields [a la Thirion's Demons (Thirion, 1998)]. In the context of the original Demons' framework, the so-called directly manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) (Tustison et al., 2009) can be viewed as a smoothing alternative in which explicit regularization is achieved through fast B-spline approximation. This characterization can be used to provide B-spline "flavored" diffeomorphic image registration solutions with several advantages. Implementation is open source and available through the Insight Toolkit and our Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) repository. A thorough comparative evaluation with the well-known SyN algorithm (Avants et al., 2008), implemented within the same framework, and its B-spline analog is performed using open labeled brain data and open source evaluation tools.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the impact of template choice on template-based segmentation of the hippocampus in epilepsy. Four dataset-specific strategies are quantitatively contrasted: the "closest to average" individual template, the average shape version of the closest to average template, a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS). The cross-correlation similarity metric drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that, with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy, optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts the study of diseased hippocampi.},

@article{Tustison:2014ab,
	abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

	abstract = {A variant of the popular nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3) algorithm is proposed for bias field correction. Given the superb performance of N3 and its public availability, it has been the subject of several evaluation studies. These studies have demonstrated the importance of certain parameters associated with the B-spline least-squares fitting. We propose the substitution of a recently developed fast and robust B-spline approximation routine and a modified hierarchical optimization scheme for improved bias field correction over the original N3 algorithm. Similar to the N3 algorithm, we also make the source code, testing, and technical documentation of our contribution, which we denote as "N4ITK," available to the public through the Insight Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health. Performance assessment is demonstrated using simulated data from the publicly available Brainweb database, hyperpolarized (3)He lung image data, and 9.4T postmortem hippocampus data.},

@article{Avants:2014aa,
	abstract = {Publicly available scientific resources help establish evaluation standards, provide a platform for teaching and improve reproducibility. Version 4 of the Insight ToolKit (ITK(4)) seeks to establish new standards in publicly available image registration methodology. ITK(4) makes several advances in comparison to previous versions of ITK. ITK(4) supports both multivariate images and objective functions; it also unifies high-dimensional (deformation field) and low-dimensional (affine) transformations with metrics that are reusable across transform types and with composite transforms that allow arbitrary series of geometric mappings to be chained together seamlessly. Metrics and optimizers take advantage of multi-core resources, when available. Furthermore, ITK(4) reduces the parameter optimization burden via principled heuristics that automatically set scaling across disparate parameter types (rotations vs. translations). A related approach also constrains steps sizes for gradient-based optimizers. The result is that tuning for different metrics and/or image pairs is rarely necessary allowing the researcher to more easily focus on design/comparison of registration strategies. In total, the ITK(4) contribution is intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices, will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate new work in image registration and also enable application level programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build. Finally, we contextualize this work with a reference registration evaluation study with application to pediatric brain labeling.},
