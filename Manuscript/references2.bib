@article{Avants:2023aa,
	abstract = {We propose a new perceptual super resolution (PSR) method for 3D neuroimaging and evaluate its performance in detecting brain changes due to neurodegenerative disease. The method, concurrent super resolution and segmentation (CSRS), is trained on volumetric brain data to consistently upsample both an image intensity channel and associated segmentation labels. The simultaneous nature of the method improves not only the resolution of the images but also the resolution of associated segmentations thereby making the approach directly applicable to existing labeled datasets. One challenge to real world evaluation of SR methods such as CSRS is the lack of high resolution ground truth in the target application data: clinical neuroimages. We therefore evaluate CSRS effectiveness in an adjacent, clinically relevant signal detection problem: quantifying cross-sectional and longitudinal change across a set of phenotypically heterogeneous but related disorders that exhibit known and differentiable patterns of brain atrophy. We contrast several 3D PSR loss functions in this paradigm and show that CSRS consistently increases the ability to detect regional atrophy both longitudinally and cross-sectionally in each of five related diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNoneAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study used (or will use) ONLY openly available human data that were originally located at: https://ida.loni.usc.edu/ (in particular 4RTNI, NIFD), PPMI https://www.ppmi-info.org and http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/data/ Further details are in the manuscript.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

@article{Sethian:1996vr,
	abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

@article{Fonov:2011vg,
	abstract = {Spatial normalization, registration, and segmentation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) often use a target or template volume to facilitate processing, take advantage of prior information, and define a common coordinate system for analysis. In the neuroimaging literature, the MNI305 Talairach-like coordinate system is often used as a standard template. However, when studying pediatric populations, variation from the adult brain makes the MNI305 suboptimal for processing brain images of children. Morphological changes occurring during development render the use of age-appropriate templates desirable to reduce potential errors and minimize bias during processing of pediatric data. This paper presents the methods used to create unbiased, age-appropriate MRI atlas templates for pediatric studies that represent the average anatomy for the age range of 4.5-18.5 years, while maintaining a high level of anatomical detail and contrast. The creation of anatomical T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted templates for specific developmentally important age-ranges, used data derived from the largest epidemiological, representative (healthy and normal) sample of the U.S. population, where each subject was carefully screened for medical and psychiatric factors and characterized using established neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. Use of these age-specific templates was evaluated by computing average tissue maps for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid for each specific age range, and by conducting an exemplar voxel-wise deformation-based morphometry study using 66 young (4.5-6.9 years) participants to demonstrate the benefits of using the age-appropriate templates. The public availability of these atlases/templates will facilitate analysis of pediatric MRI data and enable comparison of results between studies in a common standardized space specific to pediatric research.},

@article{Tustison:2021vi,
	abstract = {The Advanced Normalizations Tools ecosystem, known as ANTsX, consists of multiple open-source software libraries which house top-performing algorithms used worldwide by scientific and research communities for processing and analyzing biological and medical imaging data. The base software library, ANTs, is built upon, and contributes to, the NIH-sponsored Insight Toolkit. Founded in 2008 with the highly regarded Symmetric Normalization image registration framework, the ANTs library has since grown to include additional functionality. Recent enhancements include statistical, visualization, and deep learning capabilities through interfacing with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and Python (ANTsPy). Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain several popular network architectures and trained models for specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural T1-weighted brain MRI, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These pipelines significantly improve computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over multiple criteria relative to the existing ANTs workflows and simultaneously illustrate the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a framework for medical image analysis.},

@article{Vos:2019wr,
	abstract = {Image registration, the process of aligning two or more images, is the core technique of many (semi-)automatic medical image analysis tasks. Recent studies have shown that deep learning methods, notably convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), can be used for image registration. Thus far training of ConvNets for registration was supervised using predefined example registrations. However, obtaining example registrations is not trivial. To circumvent the need for predefined examples, and thereby to increase convenience of training ConvNets for image registration, we propose the Deep Learning Image Registration (DLIR) framework for unsupervised affine and deformable image registration. In the DLIR framework ConvNets are trained for image registration by exploiting image similarity analogous to conventional intensity-based image registration. After a ConvNet has been trained with the DLIR framework, it can be used to register pairs of unseen images in one shot. We propose flexible ConvNets designs for affine image registration and for deformable image registration. By stacking multiple of these ConvNets into a larger architecture, we are able to perform coarse-to-fine image registration. We show for registration of cardiac cine MRI and registration of chest CT that performance of the DLIR framework is comparable to conventional image registration while being several orders of magnitude faster.},

We show that extending this idea to allow concatenation of features across up- and downsampling stages (Dense DBPN) allows us to reconstruct further improve super-resolution, yielding superior results and in particular establishing new state of the art results for large scaling factors such as 8× across multiple data sets.},

@article{Bashyam:2020aa,
	abstract = {Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach to constructing imaging signatures of normal brain ageing as well as of various neuropathological processes associated with brain diseases. In particular, MRI-derived brain age has been used as a comprehensive biomarker of brain health that can identify both advanced and resilient ageing individuals via deviations from typical brain ageing. Imaging signatures of various brain diseases, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, have also been identified using machine learning. Prior efforts to derive these indices have been hampered by the need for sophisticated and not easily reproducible processing steps, by insufficiently powered or diversified samples from which typical brain ageing trajectories were derived, and by limited reproducibility across populations and MRI scanners. Herein, we develop and test a sophisticated deep brain network (DeepBrainNet) using a large (n = 11 729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning different studies, scanners, ages and geographic locations around the world. Tests using both cross-validation and a separate replication cohort of 2739 individuals indicate that DeepBrainNet obtains robust brain-age estimates from these diverse datasets without the need for specialized image data preparation and processing. Furthermore, we show evidence that moderately fit brain ageing models may provide brain age estimates that are most discriminant of individuals with pathologies. This is not unexpected as tightly-fitting brain age models naturally produce brain-age estimates that offer little information beyond age, and loosely fitting models may contain a lot of noise. Our results offer some experimental evidence against commonly pursued tightly-fitting models. We show that the moderately fitting brain age models obtain significantly higher differentiation compared to tightly-fitting models in two of the four disease groups tested. Critically, we demonstrate that leveraging DeepBrainNet, along with transfer learning, allows us to construct more accurate classifiers of several brain diseases, compared to directly training classifiers on patient versus healthy control datasets or using common imaging databases such as ImageNet. We, therefore, derive a domain-specific deep network likely to reduce the need for application-specific adaptation and tuning of generic deep learning networks. We made the DeepBrainNet model freely available to the community for MRI-based evaluation of brain health in the general population and over the lifespan.},

Currently, two different computational paradigms exist, with methods generally classified as either surface or voxel-based. This paper provides a much needed comparison of the surface-based method FreeSurfer and two voxel-based methods using clinical data. We test the effects of computing regional statistics using two different atlases and demonstrate that this makes a significant difference to the cortical thickness results. We assess reproducibility, and show that FreeSurfer has a regional standard deviation of thickness difference on same day scans that is significantly lower than either a Laplacian or Registration based method and discuss the trade off between reproducibility and segmentation accuracy caused by bending energy constraints. We demonstrate that voxel-based methods can detect similar patterns of group-wise differences as well as FreeSurfer in typical applications such as producing group-wise maps of statistically significant thickness change, but that regional statistics can vary between methods. We use a Support Vector Machine to classify patients against controls and did not find statistically significantly different results with voxel based methods compared to FreeSurfer. Finally we assessed longitudinal performance and concluded that currently FreeSurfer provides the most plausible measure of change over time, with further work required for voxel based methods.},

@article{Schwarz:2016aa,
	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) researchers commonly use MRI as a quantitative measure of disease severity. Historically, hippocampal volume has been favored. Recently, "AD signature" measurements of gray matter (GM) volumes or cortical thicknesses have gained attention. Here, we systematically evaluate multiple thickness- and volume-based candidate-methods side-by-side, built using the popular FreeSurfer, SPM, and ANTs packages, according to the following criteria: (a) ability to separate clinically normal individuals from those with AD; (b) (extent of) correlation with head size, a nuisance covariatel (c) reliability on repeated scans; and (d) correlation with Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage in a group with autopsy. We show that volume- and thickness-based measures generally perform similarly for separating clinically normal from AD populations, and in correlation with Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage at autopsy. Volume-based measures are generally more reliable than thickness measures. As expected, volume measures are highly correlated with head size, while thickness measures are generally not. Because approaches to statistically correcting volumes for head size vary and may be inadequate to deal with this underlying confound, and because our goal is to determine a measure which can be used to examine age and sex effects in a cohort across a large age range, we thus recommend thickness-based measures. Ultimately, based on these criteria and additional practical considerations of run-time and failure rates, we recommend an AD signature measure formed from a composite of thickness measurements in the entorhinal, fusiform, parahippocampal, mid-temporal, inferior-temporal, and angular gyrus ROIs using ANTs with input segmentations from SPM12.},

	abstract = {The lack of a standard image intensity scale in MRI causes many difficulties in image display and analysis. A two-step postprocessing method is proposed for standardizing the intensity scale in such a way that for the same MR protocol and body region, similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. In the first step, the parameters of the standardizing transformation are "learned" from a set of images. In the second step, for each MR study these parameters are used to map their histogram into the standardized histogram. The method was tested quantitatively on 90 whole-brain studies of multiple sclerosis patients for several protocols and qualitatively for several other protocols and body regions. Measurements using mean squared difference showed that the standardized image intensities have statistically significantly (P < 0.01) more consistent range and meaning than the originals. Fixed gray level windows can be established for the standardized images and used for display without the need of per case adjustment. Preliminary results also indicate that the method facilitates improving the degree of automation of image segmentation. Magn Reson Med 42:1072-1081, 1999.},

	abstract = {Longitudinal image analysis has become increasingly important in clinical studies of normal aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects.},

However, selection among noisy measurements can render circular an otherwise appropriate analysis and invalidate results. Here we argue that systems neuroscience needs to adjust some widespread practices to avoid the circularity that can arise from selection. In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question. Spurious effects can appear in the context of both univariate activation analysis and multivariate pattern-information analysis. We suggest a policy for avoiding circularity.},

@article{Lemaitre:2012aa,
	abstract = {Normal aging is accompanied by global as well as regional structural changes. While these age-related changes in gray matter volume have been extensively studied, less has been done using newer morphological indexes, such as cortical thickness and surface area. To this end, we analyzed structural images of 216 healthy volunteers, ranging from 18 to 87 years of age, using a surface-based automated parcellation approach. Linear regressions of age revealed a concomitant global age-related reduction in cortical thickness, surface area and volume. Cortical thickness and volume collectively confirmed the vulnerability of the prefrontal cortex, whereas in other cortical regions, such as in the parietal cortex, thickness was the only measure sensitive to the pronounced age-related atrophy. No cortical regions showed more surface area reduction than the global average. The distinction between these morphological measures may provide valuable information to dissect age-related structural changes of the brain, with each of these indexes probably reflecting specific histological changes occurring during aging.},

	abstract = {Modern MRI image processing methods have yielded quantitative, morphometric, functional, and structural assessments of the human brain. These analyses typically exploit carefully optimized protocols for specific imaging targets. Algorithm investigators have several excellent public data resources to use to test, develop, and optimize their methods. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining MRI protocols in multi-parametric studies. Notably, these have included innovative approaches for fusing connectivity inferences with functional and/or anatomical characterizations. Yet, validation of the reproducibility of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered by the limited availability of appropriate multi-parametric data. We present an imaging protocol optimized to include state-of-the-art assessment of brain function, structure, micro-architecture, and quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible 60-min protocol on a 3-T MRI scanner. We present scan-rescan reproducibility of these imaging contrasts based on 21 healthy volunteers (11 M/10 F, 22-61 years old). The cortical gray matter, cortical white matter, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, thalamus, putamen, caudate, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, and brainstem were identified with mean volume-wise reproducibility of 3.5%. We tabulate the mean intensity, variability, and reproducibility of each contrast in a region of interest approach, which is essential for prospective study planning and retrospective power analysis considerations. Anatomy was highly consistent on structural acquisition (~1-5% variability), while variation on diffusion and several other quantitative scans was higher (~<10%). Some sequences are particularly variable in specific structures (ASL exhibited variation of 28% in the cerebral white matter) or in thin structures (quantitative T2 varied by up to 73% in the caudate) due, in large part, to variability in automated ROI placement. The richness of the joint distribution of intensities across imaging methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis approach as opposed to a summary table. As such, all imaging data and analysis routines have been made publicly and freely available. This effort provides the neuroimaging community with a resource for optimization of algorithms that exploit the diversity of modern MRI modalities. Additionally, it establishes a baseline for continuing development and optimization of multi-parametric imaging protocols.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We propose an automated segmentation pipeline based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness. The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Supporting this work is the open-source ANTsRNet-a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures first introduced here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Training (including template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 functional lung MRI. Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 and 40 images, respectively.
RESULTS: Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.93 $\pm$ 0.03, right lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02, and whole lung: 0.94 $\pm$ 0.02. Although slightly less accurate than our previously reported joint label fusion approach (left lung: 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02, right lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01, and whole lung: 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01), processing time is <1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ∼30 minutes per subject using joint label fusion. Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers.
CONCLUSION: The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in near real time. CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of functional lung MRI.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel attention gate (AG) model for medical image analysis that automatically learns to focus on target structures of varying shapes and sizes. Models trained with AGs implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for a specific task. This enables us to eliminate the necessity of using explicit external tissue/organ localisation modules when using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN models such as VGG or U-Net architectures with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed AG models are evaluated on a variety of tasks, including medical image classification and segmentation. For classification, we demonstrate the use case of AGs in scan plane detection for fetal ultrasound screening. We show that the proposed attention mechanism can provide efficient object localisation while improving the overall prediction performance by reducing false positives. For segmentation, the proposed architecture is evaluated on two large 3D CT abdominal datasets with manual annotations for multiple organs. Experimental results show that AG models consistently improve the prediction performance of the base architectures across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency. Moreover, AGs guide the model activations to be focused around salient regions, which provides better insights into how model predictions are made. The source code for the proposed AG models is publicly available.},

@article{Ashburner:2000aa,
	abstract = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data.},

@article{Avants:2012aa,
	abstract = {We contribute a novel and interpretable dimensionality reduction strategy, eigenanatomy, that is tuned for neuroimaging data. The method approximates the eigendecomposition of an image set with basis functions (the eigenanatomy vectors) that are sparse, unsigned and are anatomically clustered. We employ the eigenanatomy vectors as anatomical predictors to improve detection power in morphometry. Standard voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyzes imaging data voxel-by-voxel--and follows this with cluster-based or voxel-wise multiple comparisons correction methods to determine significance. Eigenanatomy reverses the standard order of operations by first clustering the voxel data and then using standard linear regression in this reduced dimensionality space. As with traditional region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, this strategy can greatly improve detection power. Our results show that eigenanatomy provides a principled objective function that leads to localized, data-driven regions of interest. These regions improve our ability to quantify biologically plausible rates of cortical change in two distinct forms of neurodegeneration. We detail the algorithm and show experimental evidence of its efficacy.},

	abstract = {Traditional neuroimage analysis pipelines involve computationally intensive, time-consuming optimization steps, and thus, do not scale well to large cohort studies with thousands or tens of thousands of individuals. In this work we propose a fast and accurate deep learning based neuroimaging pipeline for the automated processing of structural human brain MRI scans, replicating FreeSurfer's anatomical segmentation including surface reconstruction and cortical parcellation. To this end, we introduce an advanced deep learning architecture capable of whole-brain segmentation into 95 classes. The network architecture incorporates local and global competition via competitive dense blocks and competitive skip pathways, as well as multi-slice information aggregation that specifically tailor network performance towards accurate segmentation of both cortical and subcortical structures. Further, we perform fast cortical surface reconstruction and thickness analysis by introducing a spectral spherical embedding and by directly mapping the cortical labels from the image to the surface. This approach provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (in under 1 ​min) and surface-based thickness analysis (within only around 1 ​h runtime). For sustainability of this approach we perform extensive validation: we assert high segmentation accuracy on several unseen datasets, measure generalizability and demonstrate increased test-retest reliability, and high sensitivity to group differences in dementia.},

@article{Rebsamen:2020aa,
	abstract = {Accurate and reliable measures of cortical thickness from magnetic resonance imaging are an important biomarker to study neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Diffeomorphic registration-based cortical thickness (DiReCT) is a known technique to derive such measures from non-surface-based volumetric tissue maps. ANTs provides an open-source method for estimating cortical thickness, derived by applying DiReCT to an atlas-based segmentation. In this paper, we propose DL+DiReCT, a method using high-quality deep learning-based neuroanatomy segmentations followed by DiReCT, yielding accurate and reliable cortical thickness measures in a short time. We evaluate the methods on two independent datasets and compare the results against surface-based measures from FreeSurfer. Good correlation of DL+DiReCT with FreeSurfer was observed (r = .887) for global mean cortical thickness compared to ANTs versus FreeSurfer (r = .608). Experiments suggest that both DiReCT-based methods had higher sensitivity to changes in cortical thickness than Freesurfer. However, while ANTs showed low scan-rescan robustness, DL+DiReCT showed similar robustness to Freesurfer. Effect-sizes for group-wise differences of healthy controls compared to individuals with dementia were highest with the deep learning-based segmentation. DL+DiReCT is a promising combination of a deep learning-based method with a traditional registration technique to detect subtle changes in cortical thickness.},

@article{Lei:2019aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Automated synthetic computed tomography (sCT) generation based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images would allow for MRI-only based treatment planning in radiation therapy, eliminating the need for CT simulation and simplifying the patient treatment workflow. In this work, the authors propose a novel method for generation of sCT based on dense cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (cycle GAN), a deep-learning based model that trains two transformation mappings (MRI to CT and CT to MRI) simultaneously.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cycle GAN-based model was developed to generate sCT images in a patch-based framework. Cycle GAN was applied to this problem because it includes an inverse transformation from CT to MRI, which helps constrain the model to learn a one-to-one mapping. Dense block-based networks were used to construct generator of cycle GAN. The network weights and variables were optimized via a gradient difference (GD) loss and a novel distance loss metric between sCT and original CT.
RESULTS: Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to validate the proposed model. The mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and normalized cross correlation (NCC) indexes were used to quantify the differences between the sCT and original planning CT images. For the proposed method, the mean MAE between sCT and CT were 55.7 Hounsfield units (HU) for 24 brain cancer patients and 50.8 HU for 20 prostate cancer patients. The mean PSNR and NCC were 26.6 dB and 0.963 in the brain cases, and 24.5 dB and 0.929 in the pelvis.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a novel learning-based approach to generate CT images from routine MRIs based on dense cycle GAN model to effectively capture the relationship between the CT and MRIs. The proposed method can generate robust, high-quality sCT in minutes. The proposed method offers strong potential for supporting near real-time MRI-only treatment planning in the brain and pelvis.},

	abstract = {Lewy bodies commonly occur in Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's disease pathology is frequent in Lewy body diseases, but the burden of co-pathologies across neurodegenerative diseases is unknown. We assessed the extent of tau, amyloid-β, α-synuclein and TDP-43 proteinopathies in 766 autopsied individuals representing a broad spectrum of clinical neurodegenerative disease. We interrogated pathological Alzheimer's disease (n = 247); other tauopathies (n = 95) including Pick's disease, corticobasal disease and progressive supranuclear palsy; the synucleinopathies (n = 164) including multiple system atrophy and Lewy body disease; the TDP-43 proteinopathies (n = 188) including frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and a minimal pathology group (n = 72). Each group was divided into subgroups without or with co-pathologies. Age and sex matched logistic regression models compared co-pathology prevalence between groups. Co-pathology prevalence was similar between the minimal pathology group and most neurodegenerative diseases for each proteinopathy: tau was nearly universal (92-100%), amyloid-β common (20-57%); α-synuclein less common (4-16%); and TDP-43 the rarest (0-16%). In several neurodegenerative diseases, co-pathology increased: in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein (41-55%) and TDP-43 (33-40%) increased; in progressive supranuclear palsy, α-synuclein increased (22%); in corticobasal disease, TDP-43 increased (24%); and in neocortical Lewy body disease, amyloid-β (80%) and TDP-43 (22%) increased. Total co-pathology prevalence varied across groups (27-68%), and was increased in high Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and neocortical Lewy body disease (70-81%). Increased age at death was observed in the minimal pathology group, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple system atrophy cases with co-pathologies. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neocortical Lewy body disease, co-pathologies associated with APOE ɛ4. Lewy body disease cases with Alzheimer's disease co-pathology had substantially lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores than pure Lewy body disease. Our data imply that increased age and APOE ɛ4 status are risk factors for co-pathologies independent of neurodegenerative disease; that neurodegenerative disease severity influences co-pathology as evidenced by the prevalence of co-pathology in high Alzheimer's disease and neocortical Lewy body disease, but not intermediate Alzheimer's disease or limbic Lewy body disease; and that tau and α-synuclein strains may also modify co-pathologies since tauopathies and synucleinopathies had differing co-pathologies and burdens. These findings have implications for clinical trials that focus on monotherapies targeting tau, amyloid-β, α-synuclein and TDP-43.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging pipelines are known to generate different results depending on the computing platform where they are compiled and executed. We quantify these differences for brain tissue classification, fMRI analysis, and cortical thickness (CT) extraction, using three of the main neuroimaging packages (FSL, Freesurfer and CIVET) and different versions of GNU/Linux. We also identify some causes of these differences using library and system call interception. We find that these packages use mathematical functions based on single-precision floating-point arithmetic whose implementations in operating systems continue to evolve. While these differences have little or no impact on simple analysis pipelines such as brain extraction and cortical tissue classification, their accumulation creates important differences in longer pipelines such as subcortical tissue classification, fMRI analysis, and cortical thickness extraction. With FSL, most Dice coefficients between subcortical classifications obtained on different operating systems remain above 0.9, but values as low as 0.59 are observed. Independent component analyses (ICA) of fMRI data differ between operating systems in one third of the tested subjects, due to differences in motion correction. With Freesurfer and CIVET, in some brain regions we find an effect of build or operating system on cortical thickness. A first step to correct these reproducibility issues would be to use more precise representations of floating-point numbers in the critical sections of the pipelines. The numerical stability of pipelines should also be reviewed. },

	abstract = {Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2-5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.},

We report the development of continuous analysis, a workflow that enables reproducible computational analyses. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container technology akin to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a software development technique, to automatically rerun a computational analysis whenever updates or improvements are made to source code or data. This enables researchers to reproduce results without contacting the study authors. Continuous analysis allows reviewers, editors or readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning code and can provide an audit trail for analyses of data that cannot be shared.},

	abstract = {Although the hippocampus is one of the most studied structures in the human brain, limited quantitative data exist on its 3D organization, anatomical variability, and effects of disease on its subregions. Histological studies provide restricted reference information due to their 2D nature. In this paper, high-resolution (∼200 × 200 × 200 μm3) ex vivo MRI scans of 31 human hippocampal specimens are combined using a groupwise diffeomorphic registration approach into a 3D probabilistic atlas that captures average anatomy and anatomic variability of hippocampal subfields. Serial histological imaging in 9 of the 31 specimens was used to label hippocampal subfields in the atlas based on cytoarchitecture. Specimens were obtained from autopsies in patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD; 9 subjects, 13 hemispheres), of other dementia (nine subjects, nine hemispheres), and in subjects without dementia (seven subjects, nine hemispheres), and morphometric analysis was performed in atlas space to measure effects of age and AD on hippocampal subfields. Disproportional involvement of the cornu ammonis (CA) 1 subfield and stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare was found in AD, with lesser involvement of the dentate gyrus and CA2/3 subfields. An association with age was found for the dentate gyrus and, to a lesser extent, for CA1. Three-dimensional patterns of variability and disease and aging effects discovered via the ex vivo hippocampus atlas provide information highly relevant to the active field of in vivo hippocampal subfield imaging.},

@article{Adler:2014aa,
	abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing effort to analyze the morphometry of hippocampal subfields using both in vivo and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, given that boundaries between subregions of the hippocampal formation (HF) are conventionally defined on the basis of microscopic features that often lack discernible signature in MRI, subfield delineation in MRI literature has largely relied on heuristic geometric rules, the validity of which with respect to the underlying anatomy is largely unknown. The development and evaluation of such rules are challenged by the limited availability of data linking MRI appearance to microscopic hippocampal anatomy, particularly in three dimensions (3D). The present paper, for the first time, demonstrates the feasibility of labeling hippocampal subfields in a high resolution volumetric MRI dataset based directly on microscopic features extracted from histology. It uses a combination of computational techniques and manual post-processing to map subfield boundaries from a stack of histology images (obtained with 200μm spacing and 5μm slice thickness; stained using the Kluver-Barrera method) onto a postmortem 9.4Tesla MRI scan of the intact, whole hippocampal formation acquired with 160μm isotropic resolution. The histology reconstruction procedure consists of sequential application of a graph-theoretic slice stacking algorithm that mitigates the effects of distorted slices, followed by iterative affine and diffeomorphic co-registration to postmortem MRI scans of approximately 1cm-thick tissue sub-blocks acquired with 200μm isotropic resolution. These 1cm blocks are subsequently co-registered to the MRI of the whole HF. Reconstruction accuracy is evaluated as the average displacement error between boundaries manually delineated in both the histology and MRI following the sequential stages of reconstruction. The methods presented and evaluated in this single-subject study can potentially be applied to multiple hippocampal tissue samples in order to construct a histologically informed MRI atlas of the hippocampal formation. },

In this paper, we present a study using deep fully convolutional network and ensemble models to automatically detect such WMH using fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1 magnetic resonance (MR) scans. The algorithm was evaluated and ranked 1st in the WMH Segmentation Challenge at MICCAI 2017. In the evaluation stage, the implementation of the algorithm was submitted to the challenge organizers, who then independently tested it on a hidden set of 110 cases from 5 scanners. Averaged dice score, precision and robust Hausdorff distance obtained on held-out test datasets were 80%, 84% and 6.30 mm respectively. These were the highest achieved in the challenge, suggesting the proposed method is the state-of-the-art. Detailed descriptions and quantitative analysis on key components of the system were provided. Furthermore, a study of cross-scanner evaluation is presented to discuss how the combination of modalities affect the generalization capability of the system. The adaptability of the system to different scanners and protocols is also investigated. A quantitative study is further presented to show the effect of ensemble size and the effectiveness of the ensemble model. Additionally, software and models of our method are made publicly available. The effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed system show its potential for real-world clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Quantification of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin is of key importance in many neurological research studies. Currently, measurements are often still obtained from manual segmentations on brain MR images, which is a laborious procedure. The automatic WMH segmentation methods exist, but a standardized comparison of the performance of such methods is lacking. We organized a scientific challenge, in which developers could evaluate their methods on a standardized multi-center/-scanner image dataset, giving an objective comparison: the WMH Segmentation Challenge. Sixty T1 + FLAIR images from three MR scanners were released with the manual WMH segmentations for training. A test set of 110 images from five MR scanners was used for evaluation. The segmentation methods had to be containerized and submitted to the challenge organizers. Five evaluation metrics were used to rank the methods: 1) Dice similarity coefficient; 2) modified Hausdorff distance (95th percentile); 3) absolute log-transformed volume difference; 4) sensitivity for detecting individual lesions; and 5) F1-score for individual lesions. In addition, the methods were ranked on their inter-scanner robustness; 20 participants submitted their methods for evaluation. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the results. In brief, there is a cluster of four methods that rank significantly better than the other methods, with one clear winner. The inter-scanner robustness ranking shows that not all the methods generalize to unseen scanners. The challenge remains open for future submissions and provides a public platform for method evaluation.},

@article{Woods:1993aa,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported an automated method for within-modality (e.g., PET-to-PET) image alignment. We now describe modifications to this method that allow for cross-modality registration of MRI and PET brain images obtained from a single subject.
METHODS: This method does not require fiducial markers and the user is not required to identify common structures on the two image sets. To align the images, the algorithm seeks to minimize the standard deviation of the PET pixel values that correspond to each MRI pixel value. The MR images must be edited to exclude nonbrain regions prior to using the algorithm.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The method has been validated quantitatively using data from patients with stereotaxic fiducial markers rigidly fixed in the skull. Maximal three-dimensional errors of < 3 mm and mean three-dimensional errors of < 2 mm were measured. Computation time on a SPARCstation IPX varies from 3 to 9 min to align MR image sets with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET images. The MR alignment with noisy H2(15)O PET images typically requires 20-30 min.},

	abstract = {Medical image registration is an important task in medical image processing. It refers to the process of aligning data sets, possibly from different modalities (e.g., magnetic resonance and computed tomography), different time points (e.g., follow-up scans), and/or different subjects (in case of population studies). A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications. We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. The command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. The usage of elastix for comparing different registration methods is illustrated with three example experiments, in which individual components of the registration method are varied.},

In this work, we review the various state-of-the-art approaches to learning and prediction and/or optimizing image transformations using convolutional neural networks. Although of primary importance within the quantitative imaging domain, image registration algorithmic development, in the context of these deep learning strategies, has received comparatively less attention than its counterparts (e.g., image segmentation). Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in this particular subfield which has been presented in various research venues. We contextualize these contributions within the broader scope of deep learning advancements and, in so doing, attempt to facilitate the leveraging and further development of such techniques within the medical imaging research community.},

	abstract = {Classical deformable registration techniques achieve impressive results and offer a rigorous theoretical treatment, but are computationally intensive since they solve an optimization problem for each image pair. Recently, learning-based methods have facilitated fast registration by learning spatial deformation functions. However, these approaches use restricted deformation models, require supervised labels, or do not guarantee a diffeomorphic (topology-preserving) registration. Furthermore, learning-based registration tools have not been derived from a probabilistic framework that can offer uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we build a connection between classical and learning-based methods. We present a probabilistic generative model and derive an unsupervised learning-based inference algorithm that uses insights from classical registration methods and makes use of recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We demonstrate our method on a 3D brain registration task for both images and anatomical surfaces, and provide extensive empirical analyses of the algorithm. Our principled approach results in state of the art accuracy and very fast runtimes, while providing diffeomorphic guarantees.

	abstract = {We present VoxelMorph, a fast learning-based framework for deformable, pairwise medical image registration. Traditional registration methods optimize an objective function for each pair of images, which can be time-consuming for large datasets or rich deformation models. In contrast to this approach, and building on recent learning-based methods, we formulate registration as a function that maps an input image pair to a deformation field that aligns these images. We parameterize the function via a convolutional neural network (CNN), and optimize the parameters of the neural network on a set of images. Given a new pair of scans, VoxelMorph rapidly computes a deformation field by directly evaluating the function. In this work, we explore two different training strategies. In the first (unsupervised) setting, we train the model to maximize standard image matching objective functions that are based on the image intensities. In the second setting, we leverage auxiliary segmentations available in the training data. We demonstrate that the unsupervised model's accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while operating orders of magnitude faster. We also show that VoxelMorph trained with auxiliary data improves registration accuracy at test time, and evaluate the effect of training set size on registration. Our method promises to speed up medical image analysis and processing pipelines, while facilitating novel directions in learning-based registration and its applications.

The method extends the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) to arbitrary dimensions by making key modifications to orientation assignment and gradient histograms. Rotation invariance is proven mathematically. Additional modifications are made to extrema detection and keypoint matching based on the demands of image registration. Our experiments suggest that the choice of neighborhood in discrete extrema detection has a strong impact on image registration accuracy. In head MR images, the brain is registered to a labeled atlas with an average Dice coefficient of 92%, outperforming registration from mutual information as well as an existing 3D SIFT implementation. In abdominal CT images, the spine is registered with an average error of 4.82 mm. Furthermore, keypoints are matched with high precision in simulated head MR images exhibiting lesions from multiple sclerosis. These results were achieved using only affine transforms, and with no change in parameters across a wide variety of medical images.

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside. 3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.},

We show on controlled experiments that this advantage is confirmed in practice and yields a faster convergence. In the second part of this paper, we adapt the optimization procedure underlying the demons algorithm to a space of diffeomorphic transformations. In contrast to many diffeomorphic registration algorithms, our solution is computationally efficient since in practice it only replaces an addition of displacement fields by a few compositions. Our experiments show that in addition to being diffeomorphic, our algorithm provides results that are similar to the ones from the demons algorithm but with transformations that are much smoother and closer to the gold standard, available in controlled experiments, in terms of Jacobians.},

In this study, we trained a 3D convolutional neural network using 259 bilateral manually delineated segmentations collected from three studies, acquired at multiple sites on different scanners with variable protocols. Our training dataset consisted of elderly cases difficult to segment due to extensive atrophy, vascular disease, and lesions. Our algorithm, (HippMapp3r), was validated against four other publicly available state-of-the-art techniques (HippoDeep, FreeSurfer, SBHV, volBrain, and FIRST). HippMapp3r outperformed the other techniques on all three metrics, generating an average Dice of 0.89 and a correlation coefficient of 0.95. It was two orders of magnitude faster than some of the tested techniques. Further validation was performed on 200 subjects from two other disease populations (frontotemporal dementia and vascular cognitive impairment), highlighting our method's low outlier rate. We finally tested the methods on real and simulated "clinical adversarial" cases to study their robustness to corrupt, low-quality scans.

	abstract = {Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying assumptions. Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible research.},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations. },

	abstract = {For the past 25 years, the field of neuroimaging has witnessed the development of several software packages for processing multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to study the brain. These software packages are now routinely used by researchers and clinicians, and have contributed to important breakthroughs for the understanding of brain anatomy and function. However, no software package exists to process mpMRI data of the spinal cord. Despite the numerous clinical needs for such advanced mpMRI protocols (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, etc.), researchers have been developing specific tools that, while necessary, do not provide an integrative framework that is compatible with most usages and that is capable of reaching the community at large. This hinders cross-validation and the possibility to perform multi-center studies. In this study we introduce the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT), a comprehensive software dedicated to the processing of spinal cord MRI data. SCT builds on previously-validated methods and includes state-of-the-art MRI templates and atlases of the spinal cord, algorithms to segment and register new data to the templates, and motion correction methods for diffusion and functional time series. SCT is tailored towards standardization and automation of the processing pipeline, versatility, modularity, and it follows guidelines of software development and distribution. Preliminary applications of SCT cover a variety of studies, from cross-sectional area measures in large databases of patients, to the precise quantification of mpMRI metrics in specific spinal pathways. We anticipate that SCT will bring together the spinal cord neuroimaging community by establishing standard templates and analysis procedures.},

Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each dataset, building upon a large inventory of available tools. The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in acquisition and processing. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for fMRI data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention. By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework for software testing, we show that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than observed with commonly used preprocessing tools. fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow, which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability of results.},

@article{Peyrat:2010aa,
	abstract = {We propose a framework for the nonlinear spatiotemporal registration of 4D time-series of images based on the Diffeomorphic Demons (DD) algorithm. In this framework, the 4D spatiotemporal registration is decoupled into a 4D temporal registration, defined as mapping physiological states, and a 4D spatial registration, defined as mapping trajectories of physical points. Our contribution focuses more specifically on the 4D spatial registration that should be consistent over time as opposed to 3D registration that solely aims at mapping homologous points at a given time-point. First, we estimate in each sequence the motion displacement field, which is a dense representation of the point trajectories we want to register. Then, we perform simultaneously 3D registrations of corresponding time-points with the constraints to map the same physical points over time called the trajectory constraints. Under these constraints, we show that the 4D spatial registration can be formulated as a multichannel registration of 3D images. To solve it, we propose a novel version of the Diffeomorphic Demons (DD) algorithm extended to vector-valued 3D images, the Multichannel Diffeomorphic Demons (MDD). For evaluation, this framework is applied to the registration of 4D cardiac computed tomography (CT) sequences and compared to other standard methods with real patient data and synthetic data simulated from a physiologically realistic electromechanical cardiac model. Results show that the trajectory constraints act as a temporal regularization consistent with motion whereas the multichannel registration acts as a spatial regularization. Finally, using these trajectory constraints with multichannel registration yields the best compromise between registration accuracy, temporal and spatial smoothness, and computation times. A prospective example of application is also presented with the spatiotemporal registration of 4D cardiac CT sequences of the same patient before and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in case of atrial fibrillation (AF). The intersequence spatial transformations over a cardiac cycle allow to analyze and quantify the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and its impact on the cardiac function.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a new approach for the nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced breast MRI. A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.},

	abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

	abstract = {A general automatic approach is presented for accommodating local shape variation when mapping a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) template image into alignment with a topologically similar target image. Local shape variability is accommodated by applying a vector-field transformation to the underlying material coordinate system of the template while constraining the transformation to be smooth (globally positive definite Jacobian). Smoothness is guaranteed without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods, such as those based on linearized elasticity or thin-plate splines, in that stress restraining the motion relaxes over time allowing large-magnitude deformations. Kinematic nonlinearities are inherently necessary to maintain continuity of structures during large-magnitude deformations, and are included in all results. After initial global registration, final mappings are obtained by numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations associated with the constrained optimization problem. Automatic regridding is performed by propagating templates as the nonlinear transformations evaluated on a finite lattice become singular. Application of the method to intersubject registration of neuroanatomical structures illustrates the ability to account for local anatomical variability.},

	abstract = {Cardiac magnetic resonance perfusion examinations enable noninvasive quantification of myocardial blood flow. However, motion between frames due to breathing must be corrected for quantitative analysis. Although several methods have been proposed, there is a lack of widely available benchmarks to compare different algorithms. We sought to compare many algorithms from several groups in an open benchmark challenge. Nine clinical studies from two different centers comprising normal and diseased myocardium at both rest and stress were made available for this study. The primary validation measure was regional myocardial blood flow based on the transfer coefficient (Ktrans), which was computed using a compartment model and the myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) index. The ground truth was calculated using contours drawn manually on all frames by a single observer, and visually inspected by a second observer. Six groups participated and 19 different motion correction algorithms were compared. Each method used one of three different motion models: rigid, global affine, or local deformation. The similarity metric also varied with methods employing either sum-of-squared differences, mutual information, or cross correlation. There were no significant differences in Ktrans or MPR compared across different motion models or similarity metrics. Compared with the ground truth, only Ktrans for the sum-of-squared differences metric, and for local deformation motion models, had significant bias. In conclusion, the open benchmark enabled evaluation of clinical perfusion indices over a wide range of methods. In particular, there was no benefit of nonrigid registration techniques over the other methods evaluated in this study. The benchmark data and results are available from the Cardiac Atlas Project ( www.cardiacatlas.org).},

	abstract = {While it is nearly effortless for humans to quickly assess the perceptual similarity between two images, the underlying processes are thought to be quite complex. Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called "perceptual losses"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning from natural image to medical image has established as one of the most practical paradigms in deep learning for medical image analysis. However, to fit this paradigm, 3D imaging tasks in the most prominent imaging modalities (e.g., CT and MRI) have to be reformulated and solved in 2D, losing rich 3D anatomical information and inevitably compromising the performance. To overcome this limitation, we have built a set of models, called Generic Autodidactic Models, nicknamed Models Genesis, because they are created ex nihilo (with no manual labeling), self-taught (learned by self-supervision), and generic (served as source models for generating application-specific target models). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our Models Genesis significantly outperform learning from scratch in all five target 3D applications covering both segmentation and classification. More importantly, learning a model from scratch simply in 3D may not necessarily yield performance better than transfer learning from ImageNet in 2D, but our Models Genesis consistently top any 2D approaches including fine-tuning the models pre-trained from ImageNet as well as fine-tuning the 2D versions of our Models Genesis, confirming the importance of 3D anatomical information and significance of our Models Genesis for 3D medical imaging. This performance is attributed to our unified self-supervised learning framework, built on a simple yet powerful observation: the sophisticated yet recurrent anatomy in medical images can serve as strong supervision signals for deep models to learn common anatomical representation automatically via self-supervision. As open science, all pre-trained Models Genesis are available at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/ModelsGenesis.},

	abstract = { Longitudinal studies of development and disease in the human brain have motivated the acquisition of large neuroimaging data sets and the concomitant development of robust methodological and statistical tools for quantifying neurostructural changes. Longitudinal-specific strategies for acquisition and processing have potentially significant benefits including more consistent estimates of intra-subject measurements while retaining predictive power. Using the first phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) data, comprising over 600 subjects with multiple time points from baseline to 36 months, we evaluate the utility of longitudinal FreeSurfer and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) surrogate thickness values in the context of a linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling strategy. Specifically, we estimate the residual variability and between-subject variability associated with each processing stream as it is known from the statistical literature that minimizing the former while simultaneously maximizing the latter leads to greater scientific interpretability in terms of tighter confidence intervals in calculated mean trends, smaller prediction intervals, and narrower confidence intervals for determining cross-sectional effects. This strategy is evaluated over the entire cortex, as defined by the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol, where comparisons are made with the cross-sectional and longitudinal FreeSurfer processing streams. Subsequent linear mixed effects modeling for identifying diagnostic groupings within the ADNI cohort is provided as supporting evidence for the utility of the proposed ANTs longitudinal framework which provides unbiased structural neuroimage processing and competitive to superior power for longitudinal structural change detection.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: With (18)F-FDG PET/CT, tumor uptake intensity and heterogeneity have been associated with outcome in several cancers. This study aimed at investigating whether (18)F-FDG uptake intensity, volume or heterogeneity could predict the outcome in patients with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
METHODS: Sixty-three patients with NSCLC treated by SBRT underwent a (18)F-FDG PET/CT before treatment. Maximum and mean standard uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean), metabolic tumoral volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), as well as 13 global, local and regional textural features were analysed. The predictive value of these parameters, along with clinical features, was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Cutoff values were obtained using logistic regression analysis, and survivals were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 27.1 months for the entire cohort and 32.1 months for the surviving patients. At the end of the study, 25 patients had local and/or distant recurrence including 12 who died because of the cancer progression. None of the clinical variables was predictive of the outcome, except age, which was associated with DFS (HR 1.1, P = 0.002). None of the (18)F-FDG PET/CT or clinical parameters, except gender, were associated with OS. The univariate analysis showed that only dissimilarity (D) was associated with DSS (HR = 0.822, P = 0.037), and that several metabolic measurements were associated with DFS. In multivariate analysis, only dissimilarity was significantly associated with DSS (HR = 0.822, P = 0.037) and with DFS (HR = 0.834, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The textural feature dissimilarity measured on the baseline (18)F-FDG PET/CT appears to be a strong independent predictor of the outcome in patients with NSCLC treated by SBRT. This may help selecting patients who may benefit from closer monitoring and therapeutic optimization.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose an accurate methodological framework for automatically segmenting pulmonary proton MRI based on an optimal consensus of a spatially normalized library of annotated lung atlases.
METHODS: A library of 62 manually annotated lung atlases comprising 48 mixed healthy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthmatic subjects of a large age range with multiple ventilation levels is used to produce an optimal segmentation in proton MRI, based on a consensus of the spatially normalized library. An extension of this methodology is used to provide best-guess estimates of lobar subdivisions in proton MRI from annotated computed tomography data.
RESULTS: A leave-one-out evaluation strategy was used for evaluation. Jaccard overlap measures for the left and right lungs were used for performance comparisons relative to the current state-of-the-art (0.966 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.970 $\pm$ 0.016, respectively). Best-guess estimates for the lobes exhibited comparable performance levels (left upper: 0.882 $\pm$ 0.059, left lower: 0.868 $\pm$ 0.06, right upper: 0.852 $\pm$ 0.067, right middle: 0.657 $\pm$ 0.130, right lower: 0.873 $\pm$ 0.063).
CONCLUSION: An annotated atlas library approach can be used to provide good lung and lobe estimation in proton MRI. The proposed framework is useful for subsequent anatomically based analysis of structural and/or functional pulmonary image data.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional computerized characterization of biomedical solid textures is key to large-scale and high-throughput screening of imaging data. Such data increasingly become available in the clinical and research environments with an ever increasing spatial resolution. In this text we exhaustively analyze the state-of-the-art in 3-D biomedical texture analysis to identify the specific needs of the application domains and extract promising trends in image processing algorithms. The geometrical properties of biomedical textures are studied both in their natural space and on digitized lattices. It is found that most of the tissue types have strong multi-scale directional properties, that are well captured by imaging protocols with high resolutions and spherical spatial transfer functions. The information modeled by the various image processing techniques is analyzed and visualized by displaying their 3-D texture primitives. We demonstrate that non-convolutional approaches are expected to provide best results when the size of structures are inferior to five voxels. For larger structures, it is shown that only multi-scale directional convolutional approaches that are non-separable allow for an unbiased modeling of 3-D biomedical textures. With the increase of high-resolution isotropic imaging protocols in clinical routine and research, these models are expected to best leverage the wealth of 3-D biomedical texture analysis in the future. Future research directions and opportunities are proposed to efficiently model personalized image-based phenotypes of normal biomedical tissue and its alterations. The integration of the clinical and genomic context is expected to better explain the intra class variation of healthy biomedical textures. Using texture synthesis, this provides the exciting opportunity to simulate and visualize texture atlases of normal ageing process and disease progression for enhanced treatment planning and clinical care management.},

	abstract = {(18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) is now routinely used in oncological imaging for diagnosis and staging and increasingly to determine early response to treatment, often employing semiquantitative measures of lesion activity such as the standardized uptake value (SUV). However, the ability to predict the behaviour of a tumour in terms of future therapy response or prognosis using SUVs from a baseline scan prior to treatment is limited. It is recognized that medical images contain more useful information than may be perceived with the naked eye, leading to the field of "radiomics" whereby additional features can be extracted by computational postprocessing techniques. In recent years, evidence has slowly accumulated showing that parameters obtained by texture analysis of radiological images, reflecting the underlying spatial variation and heterogeneity of voxel intensities within a tumour, may yield additional predictive and prognostic information. It is hoped that measurement of these textural features may allow better tissue characterization as well as better stratification of treatment in clinical trials, or individualization of future cancer treatment in the clinic, than is possible with current imaging biomarkers. In this review we focus on the literature describing the emerging methods of texture analysis in (18)FDG PET/CT, as well as other imaging modalities, and how the measurement of spatial variation of voxel grey-scale intensity within an image may provide additional predictive and prognostic information, and postulate the underlying biological mechanisms.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the tumor burden as characterized by the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) measured by F-18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) PET-computed tomography (CT) in predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 91 patients with pathologically documented stages I-IIIA NSCLC. MTV and TLG were obtained according to various thresholds of the standard uptake value (SUV) of primary tumor using preoperative F-18 FDG PET-CT. We used comparison receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis to test the statistical significance of the differences among the multiple volumetric parameters calculated by various SUV cutoff values. RFS and OS were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: On comparison receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, no significant difference was found among the volumetric parameters calculated using various thresholds of SUV. Regardless of the thresholds, patients with smaller MTV and lower TLG showed longer RFS and OS. MTV and TLG measured by F-18 FDG PET-CT were found to have better predictive performance than SUVmax for recurrence and death. According to multivariate analyses, MTV2.5 was revealed as a significant prognostic factor for RFS. Tumor size over 3 cm was selected as a significant prognostic indicator of OS.
CONCLUSION: Volume-based parameters of F-18 FDG PET-CT may have a role in providing prognostic information in NSCLC patients who have received surgical treatment.},

@article{Horne:2014aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This retrospective study aims to assess the usefulness of SUV(max) from FDG-PET imaging as a prognosticator for primary biopsy-proven stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT.
METHODS: This study includes 95 patients of median age 77 years, with primary, biopsy-confirmed peripheral stage IA/IB NSCLC. All patients were treated with 60 Gy in 3 fractions with a median treatment time of six days. Local, regional, and distant failures were evaluated independently according to the terms of RTOG1021. Local, regional, and distant control, overall- and progression-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine whether SUV(max), age, KPS, gender, tumor size/T stage, or smoking history influenced outcomes. SUV(max) was evaluated as both a continuous and as a dichotomous variable using a cutoff of <5 and ≥ 5.
RESULTS: Median follow-up for the cohort was 16 months. Median OS and PFS were 25.3 and 40.3 months, respectively. SUV with a cutoff value of 5 predicted for OS and PFS (p = .024 for each) but did not achieve significance for LC (p = .256). On Cox univariate regression analysis, SUV as a dichotomous variable predicted for both OS and PFS (p = .027 and p = .030, respectively). Defined as a continuous variable, SUV(max) continued to predict for OS and PFS (p = .032 and p = .003), but also predicted LC (p = .045) and trended toward significance for DC (p = .059). SUV(max) did not predict for OS as a dichotomous or continuous variable. It did, however, predict for PFS as a continuous variable (p = .008), neared significance for local control (p = .057) and trended towards, significance for distant control (p = .092).
CONCLUSIONS: SUV(max) appears to be a statistically and clinically significant independent prognostic marker for progression-free survival in patients with stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT. Prospective studies to more accurately define the role of tumor FDG uptake in the prognosis of NSCLC are warranted.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the value of tumor response evaluation using combined interpretation of [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) for the prediction of clinical outcome and pathologic response in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery.
METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board with a waiver of informed consent. Forty-four consecutive patients (M:F = 32:12; mean age, 60.7 years) with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by curative surgery. Time to recurrence (TTR) was stratified by radiologic, metabolic, and radiologic-metabolic response using the Kaplan-Meier method. The accuracy of radiologic, metabolic, and radiologic-metabolic response criteria for the prediction of pathologic response was evaluated.
RESULTS: Radiologic-metabolic responders had a longer TTR than nonresponders (mean TTR, 58.7 months versus 22.3 months, p = 0.001 with criteria of >or=30% reduction of size and >or=50% reduction of [maximum standardized uptake value] SUVmax and mean TTR, 49.4 months versus 23.5 months, p = 0.022 with criteria of >or=30% reduction of size and >or=25% reduction of SUVmax, respectively). The TTR of radiologic responders (criteria of >or=30% reduction of size) and metabolic responders (criteria of >or=25% reduction of SUVmax) was not different from the TTR of nonresponders (p > 0.05). The accuracy for the prediction of pathologic response was 70% in radiologic responders, 52 to 75% in metabolic responders, and 73 to 82% in radiologic-metabolic responders.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor response evaluation using combined interpretation of [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and CT was more effective than single interpretation of CT response or PET response alone for the prediction of tumor recurrence and pathologic response.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We compared the diagnostic accuracy of integrated positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) with that of CT alone, that of PET alone, and that of conventional visual correlation of PET and CT in determining the stage of disease in non-small-cell lung cancer.
METHODS: In a prospective study, integrated PET-CT was performed in 50 patients with proven or suspected non-small-cell lung cancer. CT and PET alone, visually correlated PET and CT, and integrated PET-CT were evaluated separately, and a tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage was assigned on the basis of image analysis. Nodal stations were identified according to the mapping system of the American Thoracic Society. The standard of reference was histopathological assessment of tumor stage and node stage. Extrathoracic metastases were confirmed histopathologically or by at least one other imaging method. A paired sign test was used to compare integrated PET-CT with the other imaging methods.
RESULTS: Integrated PET-CT provided additional information in 20 of 49 patients (41 percent), beyond that provided by conventional visual correlation of PET and CT. Integrated PET-CT had better diagnostic accuracy than the other imaging methods. Tumor staging was significantly more accurate with integrated PET-CT than with CT alone (P=0.001), PET alone (P<0.001), or visual correlation of PET and CT (P=0.013); node staging was also significantly more accurate with integrated PET-CT than with PET alone (P=0.013). In metastasis staging, integrated PET-CT increased the diagnostic certainty in two of eight patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated PET-CT improves the diagnostic accuracy of the staging of non-small-cell lung cancer.},

@article{Hansch:2012aa,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of time-resolved parallel three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for quantitative analysis of pulmonary perfusion using a blood pool contrast agent.
METHODS: Quantitative perfusion analysis was performed using novel software to assess pulmonary blood flow (PBF), pulmonary blood volume (PBV) and mean transit time (MTT) in a quantitative manner.
RESULTS: The evaluation of lung perfusion in the normal subjects showed an increase of PBF, PBV ventrally to dorsally (gravitational direction), and the highest values at the upper lobe, with a decrease to the middle and lower lobe (isogravitational direction). MTT showed no relevant changes in either the gravitational or isogravitational directions. In comparison with normally perfused lung areas (in diseased patients), the pulmonary embolism (PE) regions showed a significantly lower mean PBF (20 $\pm$ 0.6 ml/100 ml/min, normal region 94 $\pm$ 1 ml/100 ml/min; P < 0.001), mean PBV (2 $\pm$ 0.1 ml/100 ml, normal region 9.8 $\pm$ 0.1 ml/100 ml; P < 0.001) and mean MTT (3.8 $\pm$ 0.1 s; normal region 6.3 $\pm$ 0.1; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using time-resolved dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to determine normal range and regional variation of pulmonary perfusion and perfusion deficits in patients with PE.
KEY POINTS: * Recently introduced blood pool contrast agents improve MR evaluation of lung perfusion * Regional differences in lung perfusion indicating a gravitational and isogravitational dependency. * Focal areas of significantly decreased perfusion are detectable in pulmonary embolism.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess regional differences in quantitative pulmonary perfusion parameters, i.e., pulmonary blood flow (PBF), mean transit time (MTT), and pulmonary blood volume (PBV) in the entire lung on a pixel-by-pixel basis in normal volunteers and pulmonary hypertension patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-dimensional ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging was performed in 15 normal volunteers and 25 patients with pulmonary hypertension. From the signal intensity-time course curves, PBF, MTT and PBV maps were generated using deconvolution analysis, indicator dilution theories, and the central volume principle, on a pixel-by-pixel basis. From pulmonary perfusion parameter maps of normal volunteers and pulmonary hypertension patients, regional PBF, MTT, and PBV were statistically evaluated.
RESULTS: Regional PBF, MTT, and PBV showed significant differences in the gravitational and isogravitational directions (P < 0.05). The quantitative pulmonary perfusion parameter maps demonstrated significant differences between normal volunteers and pulmonary hypertension patients (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging is feasible for the assessment of regional quantitative pulmonary perfusion parameters in the entire lung on a pixel-by-pixel basis in normal volunteers and pulmonary hypertension patients.},

Using Monte Carlo modeling, the use of simple, analytical residue models is shown to introduce large errors in flow estimates when actual, underlying vascular characteristics are not sufficiently described by the chosen function. The determination of the shape of the residue function on a regional basis is shown to be possible only at high signal-to-noise ratio. Comparison of several nonparametric deconvolution techniques showed that a nonparametric deconvolution technique (singular value decomposition) allows estimation of flow relatively independent of underlying vascular structure and volume even at low signal-to-noise ratio associated with pixel-by-pixel deconvolution.},

The algorithm uses the local image features of shape index and curvedness in order to detect candidate structures in the lung volume and applies two successive k-nearest-neighbour classifiers in the reduction of false-positives. The nodule detection system is trained and tested on three databases extracted from a large-scale experimental screening study. The databases are constructed in order to evaluate the algorithm on both randomly chosen screening data as well as data containing higher proportions of nodules requiring follow-up. The system results are extensively evaluated including performance measurements on specific nodule types and sizes within the databases and on lesions which later proved to be malignant. In a random selection of 813 scans from the screening study a sensitivity of 80% with an average 4.2 false-positives per scan is achieved. The detection results presented are a realistic measure of a CAD system performance in a low-dose screening study which includes a diverse array of nodules of many varying sizes, types and textures.},

@article{Kirby:2014aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictive value of imaging and clinical and physiological measurements of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) in patients monitored for more than 5 years for pulmonary exacerbations that required hospitalization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exacerbations requiring hospitalization were monitored over 5 years in 91 subjects who provided written informed consent. Study was local research ethics board and Health Canada approved and HIPAA compliant. Subjects with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease underwent spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, and imaging. Computed tomographic (CT) wall area and relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU ( RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU ), helium 3 ((3)He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging ventilation defect percentage ( VDP ventilation defect percentage ), and apparent diffusion coefficient were generated. Zero-inflated Poisson model was used to compare number of hospitalizations with lung function and imaging measurements.
RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were hospitalized 58 times and had significantly worse forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) (P < .0001), CT RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU (P = .02), and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P < .0001) than values in 67 subjects who were not hospitalized. In mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , nine hospitalized subjects had significantly worse FEV1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P = .02) and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .02) than values in 52 subjects who were not hospitalized. (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage was quantitatively related to CT airway morphology (r = 0.26, P = .01) and quantitatively (r = 0.61, P < .0001) and spatially related to emphysema; this spatial relationship was significantly greater for hospitalized patients with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than unhospitalized patients (P = .0006). For all subjects, number of prior hospitalizations (P < .0001), 6-minute walk test distance (P < .0001), CT RA950 relative area with attenuation values less than -950 HU (P = .03), and (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage (P = .002) were significantly related to number of hospitalizations. For 61 subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , only (3)He VDP ventilation defect percentage was significantly associated with COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (P = .01).
CONCLUSION: (3)He MR imaging VDP ventilation defect percentage represents a mixed airways-emphysema phenotype and helps identify subjects with mild to moderate COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are at risk for exacerbation that requires hospitalization.},

@article{Zosso:2011aa,
	abstract = {In this paper we present a novel geometric framework called geodesic active fields for general image registration. In image registration, one looks for the underlying deformation field that best maps one image onto another. This is a classic ill-posed inverse problem, which is usually solved by adding a regularization term. Here, we propose a multiplicative coupling between the registration term and the regularization term, which turns out to be equivalent to embed the deformation field in a weighted minimal surface problem. Then, the deformation field is driven by a minimization flow toward a harmonic map corresponding to the solution of the registration problem. This proposed approach for registration shares close similarities with the well-known geodesic active contours model in image segmentation, where the segmentation term (the edge detector function) is coupled with the regularization term (the length functional) via multiplication as well. As a matter of fact, our proposed geometric model is actually the exact mathematical generalization to vector fields of the weighted length problem for curves and surfaces introduced by Caselles-Kimmel-Sapiro. The energy of the deformation field is measured with the Polyakov energy weighted by a suitable image distance, borrowed from standard registration models. We investigate three different weighting functions, the squared error and the approximated absolute error for monomodal images, and the local joint entropy for multimodal images. As compared to specialized state-of-the-art methods tailored for specific applications, our geometric framework involves important contributions. Firstly, our general formulation for registration works on any parametrizable, smooth and differentiable surface, including nonflat and multiscale images. In the latter case, multiscale images are registered at all scales simultaneously, and the relations between space and scale are intrinsically being accounted for. Second, this method is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reparametrization invariant registration method introduced in the literature. Thirdly, the multiplicative coupling between the registration term, i.e. local image discrepancy, and the regularization term naturally results in a data-dependent tuning of the regularization strength. Finally, by choosing the metric on the deformation field one can freely interpolate between classic Gaussian and more interesting anisotropic, TV-like regularization.},

Despite the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing.

	abstract = {Measures of structural brain change based on longitudinal MR imaging are increasingly important but can be degraded by intensity non-uniformity. This non-uniformity can be more pronounced at higher field strengths, or when using multichannel receiver coils. We assessed the ability of the non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalization (N3) technique to correct non-uniformity in 72 volumetric brain MR scans from the preparatory phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Normal elderly subjects (n=18) were scanned on different 3-T scanners with a multichannel phased array receiver coil at baseline, using magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) and spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) pulse sequences, and again 2 weeks later. When applying N3, we used five brain masks of varying accuracy and four spline smoothing distances (d=50, 100, 150 and 200 mm) to ascertain which combination of parameters optimally reduces the non-uniformity. We used the normalized white matter intensity variance (standard deviation/mean) to ascertain quantitatively the correction for a single scan; we used the variance of the normalized difference image to assess quantitatively the consistency of the correction over time from registered scan pairs. Our results showed statistically significant (p<0.01) improvement in uniformity for individual scans and reduction in the normalized difference image variance when using masks that identified distinct brain tissue classes, and when using smaller spline smoothing distances (e.g., 50-100 mm) for both MP-RAGE and SPGR pulse sequences. These optimized settings may assist future large-scale studies where 3-T scanners and phased array receiver coils are used, such as ADNI, so that intensity non-uniformity does not influence the power of MR imaging to detect disease progression and the factors that influence it.},

This paper describes a novel unsupervised, information-theoretic, adaptive filter (UINTA) that improves the predictability of pixel intensities from their neighborhoods by decreasing their joint entropy. In this way, UINTA automatically discovers the statistical properties of the signal and can thereby restore a wide spectrum of images. The paper describes the formulation to minimize the joint entropy measure and presents several important practical considerations in estimating neighborhood statistics.

After the user identified the tissues, the 3D data were automatically segmented into background, facial tissue, brain matter, CSF, and lesions. Surfaces of the face, brain, lateral ventricles, tumors, and multiple sclerosis lesions are displayed using color coding and gradient shading. Color improves the visualization of segmented tissues, while gradient shading enhances the perception of depth. Manipulation of the 3D model on a workstation aids surgical planning.

	abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Numerous sequence combinations with varying repetition times (TR) and echo times (TE) were considered, and a triplet was selected consisting of long TR/long TE, short TR/short TE, and an opposed phase sequence with intermediate TR and TE. Correction to remove system-imposed intensity inhomogeneities was required for all images. Image standardization based on fat and pectoral muscle signals was necessary for intercase comparisons.

The purpose of this study is to develop a method to automatically compute breast density in breast MRI. The framework is a combination of image processing techniques to segment breast and fibroglandular tissue. Intra- and interpatient signal intensity variability is initially corrected. The breast is segmented by automatically detecting body-breast and air-breast surfaces. Subsequently, fibroglandular tissue is segmented in the breast area using expectation-maximization. A dataset of 50 cases with manual segmentations was used for evaluation. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), total overlap, false negative fraction (FNF), and false positive fraction (FPF) are used to report similarity between automatic and manual segmentations. For breast segmentation, the proposed approach obtained DSC, total overlap, FNF, and FPF values of 0.94, 0.96, 0.04, and 0.07, respectively. For fibroglandular tissue segmentation, we obtained DSC, total overlap, FNF, and FPF values of 0.80, 0.85, 0.15, and 0.22, respectively. The method is relevant for researchers investigating breast density as a risk factor for breast cancer and all the described steps can be also applied in computer aided diagnosis systems.},

Results showed (a) the homogeneity of the MR data and (b) that automated techniques were consistently superior to manual techniques. Both techniques, however, were affected by the complexity of the structure, with simpler structures (eg, the intracranial cavity) showing less variability and better spatial correlation of segmentation results between raters. Moreover, the automated techniques were completed for whole brain in a fraction of the time required to complete the equivalent segmentation manually. Additional evaluations included interrater reliability and an evaluation that included longitudinal measurement, in which one subject was imaged sequentially 24 times, with reliability computed from data collected by three raters over 1 year.

	abstract = {An algorithm dedicated to automatic segmentation of breast magnetic resonance images is presented in this paper. Our approach is based on a pipeline that includes a denoising step and statistical segmentation. The noise removal preprocessing relies on an anisotropic diffusion scheme, whereas the statistical segmentation is conducted through a Markov random field model. The continuous updating of all parameters governing the diffusion process enables automatic denoising, and the partial volume effect is also addressed during the labeling step. To assess the relevance, the Jaccard similarity coefficient was computed. Experiments were conducted on synthetic data and breast magnetic resonance images extracted from a high-risk population. The relevance of the approach for the dataset is highlighted, and we demonstrate accuracy superior to that of traditional clustering algorithms. The results emphasize the benefits of both denoising guided by input data and the inclusion of spatial dependency through a Markov random field. For example, the Jaccard coefficient for the clinical data was increased by 114%, 109%, and 140% with respect to a K-means algorithm and, respectively, for the adipose, glandular and muscle and skin components. Moreover, the agreement between the manual segmentations provided by an experienced radiologist and the automatic segmentations performed with this algorithm was good, with Jaccard coefficients equal to 0.769, 0.756, and 0.694 for the above-mentioned classes.},

	abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software
	communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting
	technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed
	by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting
	approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration
	techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically,
	these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form
	deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered
	is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline
	object describes the transformation of the image registration solution.
	Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within
	the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed
	cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast
	deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental
	novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as
	well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization
	methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization
	retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution.
	The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the
	observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible
	to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient
	used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood
	preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This
	is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation
	experimentation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for
	quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized
	helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing
	pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and
	expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed
	using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces.
	Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung
	produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces.
	Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding
	strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic
	analysis was performed on three volunteers. RESULTS: Tag lines in
	inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous
	3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains
	were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior
	portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant
	direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior.
	CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged
	(3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering
	techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits
	from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation
	of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

	abstract = {Intensity-based classification of MR images has proven problematic, even when advanced techniques are used. Intrascan and interscan intensity inhomogeneities are a common source of difficulty. While reported methods have had some success in correcting intrascan inhomogeneities, such methods require supervision for the individual scan. This paper describes a new method called adaptive segmentation that uses knowledge of tissue intensity properties and intensity inhomogeneities to correct and segment MR images. Use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm leads to a method that allows for more accurate segmentation of tissue types as well as better visualization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, that has proven to be effective in a study that includes more than 1000 brain scans. Implementation and results are described for segmenting the brain in the following types of images: axial (dual-echo spin-echo), coronal [three dimensional Fourier transform (3-DFT) gradient-echo T1-weighted] all using a conventional head coil, and a sagittal section acquired using a surface coil. The accuracy of adaptive segmentation was found to be comparable with manual segmentation, and closer to manual segmentation than supervised multivariant classification while segmenting gray and white matter.},

@article{Zhang:2001aa,
	abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques.

	abstract = {We present and evaluate a new method for automatically labeling the subfields of the hippocampal formation in focal 0.4 × 0.5 × 2.0mm(3) resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that can be acquired in the routine clinical setting with under 5 min scan time. The method combines multi-atlas segmentation, similarity-weighted voting, and a novel learning-based bias correction technique to achieve excellent agreement with manual segmentation. Initial partitioning of MRI slices into hippocampal 'head', 'body' and 'tail' slices is the only input required from the user, necessitated by the nature of the underlying segmentation protocol. Dice overlap between manual and automatic segmentation is above 0.87 for the larger subfields, CA1 and dentate gyrus, and is competitive with the best results for whole-hippocampus segmentation in the literature. Intraclass correlation of volume measurements in CA1 and dentate gyrus is above 0.89. Overlap in smaller hippocampal subfields is lower in magnitude (0.54 for CA2, 0.62 for CA3, 0.77 for subiculum and 0.79 for entorhinal cortex) but comparable to overlap between manual segmentations by trained human raters. These results support the feasibility of subfield-specific hippocampal morphometry in clinical studies of memory and neurodegenerative disease.},

	abstract = {Multi-atlas segmentation is an effective approach for automatically labeling objects of interest in biomedical images. In this approach, multiple expert-segmented example images, called atlases, are registered to a target image, and deformed atlas segmentations are combined using label fusion. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity have been particularly successful. However, one limitation of these strategies is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this limitation, we propose a new solution for the label fusion problem in which weighted voting is formulated in terms of minimizing the total expectation of labeling error and in which pairwise dependency between atlases is explicitly modeled as the joint probability of two atlases making a segmentation error at a voxel. This probability is approximated using intensity similarity between a pair of atlases and the target image in the neighborhood of each voxel. We validate our method in two medical image segmentation problems: hippocampus segmentation and hippocampus subfield segmentation in magnetic resonance (MR) images. For both problems, we show consistent and significant improvement over label fusion strategies that assign atlas weights independently.},

	abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that can result from either frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. It is critical to establish statistically powerful biomarkers that can achieve substantial cost-savings and increase the feasibility of clinical trials. We assessed three broad categories of neuroimaging methods to screen underlying FTLD and AD pathology in a clinical FTD series: global measures (e.g., ventricular volume), anatomical volumes of interest (VOIs) (e.g., hippocampus) using a standard atlas, and data-driven VOIs using Eigenanatomy. We evaluated clinical FTD patients (N = 93) with cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter (GM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess whether they had underlying FTLD or AD pathology. Linear regression was performed to identify the optimal VOIs for each method in a training dataset and then we evaluated classification sensitivity and specificity in an independent test cohort. Power was evaluated by calculating minimum sample sizes required in the test classification analyses for each model. The data-driven VOI analysis using a multimodal combination of GM MRI and DTI achieved the greatest classification accuracy (89% sensitive and 89% specific) and required a lower minimum sample size (N = 26) relative to anatomical VOI and global measures. We conclude that a data-driven VOI approach using Eigenanatomy provides more accurate classification, benefits from increased statistical power in unseen datasets, and therefore provides a robust method for screening underlying pathology in FTD patients for entry into clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Linking structural neuroimaging data from multiple modalities to cognitive performance is an important challenge for cognitive neuroscience. In this study we examined the relationship between verbal fluency performance and neuroanatomy in 54 patients with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and 15 age-matched controls, all of whom had T1- and diffusion-weighted imaging. Our goal was to incorporate measures of both gray matter (voxel-based cortical thickness) and white matter (fractional anisotropy) into a single statistical model that relates to behavioral performance. We first used eigenanatomy to define data-driven regions of interest (DD-ROIs) for both gray matter and white matter. Eigenanatomy is a multivariate dimensionality reduction approach that identifies spatially smooth, unsigned principal components that explain the maximal amount of variance across subjects. We then used a statistical model selection procedure to see which of these DD-ROIs best modeled performance on verbal fluency tasks hypothesized to rely on distinct components of a large-scale neural network that support language: category fluency requires a semantic-guided search and is hypothesized to rely primarily on temporal cortices that support lexical-semantic representations; letter-guided fluency requires a strategic mental search and is hypothesized to require executive resources to support a more demanding search process, which depends on prefrontal cortex in addition to temporal network components that support lexical representations. We observed that both types of verbal fluency performance are best described by a network that includes a combination of gray matter and white matter. For category fluency, the identified regions included bilateral temporal cortex and a white matter region including left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and frontal-occipital fasciculus. For letter fluency, a left temporal lobe region was also selected, and also regions of frontal cortex. These results are consistent with our hypothesized neuroanatomical models of language processing and its breakdown in FTD. We conclude that clustering the data with eigenanatomy before performing linear regression is a promising tool for multimodal data analysis.},

Such efforts can be enhanced by a population atlas of canine brain anatomy to implement group analyses. Here we present a canine brain atlas derived as the diffeomorphic average of a population of fifteen mesaticephalic dogs. The atlas includes: 1) A brain template derived from in-vivo, T1-weighted imaging at 1 mm isotropic resolution at 3 Tesla (with and without the soft tissues of the head); 2) A co-registered, high-resolution (0.33 mm isotropic) template created from imaging of ex-vivo brains at 7 Tesla; 3) A surface representation of the gray matter/white matter boundary of the high-resolution atlas (including labeling of gyral and sulcal features). The properties of the atlas are considered in relation to historical nomenclature and the evolutionary taxonomy of the Canini tribe.

However, Caucasian and Mexican-American subjects had similar FVC and FEV1 values with respect to height, and African-American subjects had lower values. These differences may be partially due to differences in body build: observed Mexican-Americans were shorter than Caucasian subjects of the same age, and African-Americans on average have a smaller trunk:leg ratio than do Caucasians. Reference values and lower limits of normal were derived using a piecewise polynomial model with age and height as predictors. These reference values encompass a wide age range for three race/ethnic groups and should prove useful for diagnostic and research purposes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe) diffusion MR can detect the expected enlargement of alveoli that occurs with lung growth during childhood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 29 normal subjects aged four to 30 years underwent HHe diffusion MR imaging with the b-value pair 0, 1.6 second/cm(2). A second acquisition during a separate breathhold was performed using the b-value pair 0, 4 second/cm(2) to evaluate the dependence on b-value. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and lung volume for each acquisition and each subject was determined.
RESULTS: Subjects as young as four years of age were able to cooperate with the imaging procedure. The mean ADC increased with increasing subject age (r = 0.8; P < 0.001), with a 55% increase in mean ADC from the youngest to oldest subject. Lung volumes measured on MR were highly repeatable for the two HHe MR acquisitions (r = 0.980, P < 0.001). The mean ADC values measured with the two different b-value pairs were highly correlated (r = 0.975; P < 0.001), but the higher b-value pair resulted in slightly lower mean ADCs (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: HHe diffusion MR appears to detect the expected increase in alveolar size during childhood, and thus HHe MR may be a noninvasive method to assess development of the lung microstructure.},

	abstract = {Magnetic-resonance spectroscopy and imaging using hyperpolarized xenon-129 show great potential for evaluation of the most important function of the human lung -- gas exchange. In particular, chemical shift saturation recovery (CSSR) xenon-129 spectroscopy provides important physiological information for the lung as a whole by characterizing the dynamic process of gas exchange, while dissolved-phase (DP) xenon-129 imaging captures the time-averaged regional distribution of gas uptake by lung tissue and blood. Herein, we present recent advances in assessing lung function using CSSR spectroscopy and DP imaging in a total of 45 subjects (23 healthy, 13 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 9 asthma). From CSSR acquisitions, the COPD subjects showed red blood cell to tissue-plasma (RBC-to-TP) ratios below the average for the healthy subjects (p < 0.001), but significantly higher septal wall thicknesses as compared with the healthy subjects (p < 0.005); the RBC-to-TP ratios for the asthmatic subjects fell outside two standard deviations (either higher or lower) from the mean of the healthy subjects, although there was no statistically significant difference for the average ratio of the study group as a whole. Similarly, from the 3D DP imaging acquisitions, we found that all the ratios (TP to gas phase (GP), RBC to GP, RBC to TP) measured in the COPD subjects were lower than those from the healthy subjects (p < 0.05 for all ratios), while these ratios in the asthmatic subjects differed considerably between subjects. Despite having been performed at different lung inflation levels, the RBC-to-TP ratios measured by CSSR and 3D DP imaging were fairly consistent with each other, with a mean difference of 0.037 (ratios from 3D DP imaging larger). In ten subjects the RBC-to-GP ratios obtained from the 3D DP imaging acquisitions were also highly correlated with their diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide per unit alveolar volume ratios measured by pulmonary function testing (R = 0.91).},

	abstract = {Despite a myriad of technical advances in medical imaging, as well as the growing need to address the global impact of pulmonary diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on health and quality of life, it remains challenging to obtain in vivo regional depiction and quantification of the most basic physiological functions of the lung-gas delivery to the airspaces and gas uptake by the lung parenchyma and blood-in a manner suitable for routine application in humans. We report a method based on MRI of hyperpolarized xenon-129 that permits simultaneous observation of the 3D distributions of ventilation (gas delivery) and gas uptake, as well as quantification of regional gas uptake based on the associated ventilation. Subjects with lung disease showed variations in gas uptake that differed from those in ventilation in many regions, suggesting that gas uptake as measured by this technique reflects such features as underlying pathological alterations of lung tissue or of local blood flow. Furthermore, the ratio of the signal associated with gas uptake to that associated with ventilation was substantially altered in subjects with lung disease compared with healthy subjects. This MRI-based method provides a way to quantify relationships among gas delivery, exchange, and transport, and appears to have significant potential to provide more insight into lung disease.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and test a method to noninvasively assess the functional lung microstructure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Multiple exchange time Xenon polarization Transfer Contrast technique (MXTC) encodes xenon gas-exchange contrast at multiple delay times permitting two lung-function parameters to be derived: (i) MXTC-F, the long exchange-time depolarization value, which is proportional to the tissue to alveolar-volume ratio and (ii) MXTC-S, the square root of the xenon exchange-time constant, which characterizes thickness and composition of alveolar septa. Three healthy volunteers, one asthmatic, and two chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (GOLD stage I and II) subjects were imaged with MXTC MRI. In a subset of subjects, hyperpolarized xenon-129 ADC MRI and CT imaging were also performed.
RESULTS: The MXTC-S parameter was found to be elevated in subjects with lung disease (P-value = 0.018). In the MXTC-F parameter map it was feasible to identify regional loss of functional tissue in a COPD patient. MXTC-F maps showed excellent regional correlation with CT and ADC (P ≥ 0.90) in one COPD subject.
CONCLUSION: The functional tissue-density parameter MXTC-F showed regional agreement with other imaging techniques. The newly developed parameter MXTC-S, which characterizes the functional thickness of alveolar septa, has potential as a novel biomarker for regional parenchymal inflammation or thickening.},

	abstract = {To evaluate our system for elastically deforming a three-dimensional atlas to match anatomical brain images, six deformed versions of an atlas were generated. The deformed atlases were created by elastically mapping an anatomical brain atlas onto different MR brain image volumes. The mapping matches the edges of the ventricles and the surface of the brain; the resultant deformations are propagated through the atlas volume, deforming the remainder of the structures in the process. The atlas was then elastically matched to its deformed versions. The accuracy of the resultant matches was evaluated by determining the correspondence of 32 cortical and subcortical structures. The system on average matched the centroid of a structure to within 1 mm of its true position and fit a structure to within 11% of its true volume. The overlap between the matched and true structures, defined by the ratio between the volume of their intersection and the volume of their union, averaged 66%. When the gray-white interface was included for matching, the mean overlap improved to 78%; each structure was matched to within 0.6 mm of its true position and fit to within 6% of its true volume. Preliminary studies were also made to determine the effect of the compliance of the atlas on the resultant match.},

	abstract = {Early detection of lung nodules is extremely important for the diagnosis and clinical management of lung cancer. In this paper, a novel computer aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of pulmonary nodules in thoracic computed tomography (CT) imagery is presented. The paper describes the architecture of the CAD system and assesses its performance on a publicly available database to serve as a benchmark for future research efforts. Training and tuning of all modules in our CAD system is done using a separate and independent dataset provided courtesy of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The publicly available testing dataset is that created by the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). The LIDC data used here is comprised of 84 CT scans containing 143 nodules ranging from 3 to 30mm in effective size that are manually segmented at least by one of the four radiologists. The CAD system uses a fully automated lung segmentation algorithm to define the boundaries of the lung regions. It combines intensity thresholding with morphological processing to detect and segment nodule candidates simultaneously. A set of 245 features is computed for each segmented nodule candidate. A sequential forward selection process is used to determine the optimum subset of features for two distinct classifiers, a Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) classifier and a quadratic classifier. A performance comparison between the two classifiers is presented, and based on this, the FLD classifier is selected for the CAD system. With an average of 517.5 nodule candidates per case/scan (517.5+/-72.9), the proposed front-end detector/segmentor is able to detect 92.8% of all the nodules in the LIDC/testing dataset (based on merged ground truth). The mean overlap between the nodule regions delineated by three or more radiologists and the ones segmented by the proposed segmentation algorithm is approximately 63%. Overall, with a specificity of 3 false positives (FPs) per case/patient on average, the CAD system is able to correctly identify 80.4% of the nodules (115/143) using 40 selected features. A 7-fold cross-validation performance analysis using the LIDC database only shows CAD sensitivity of 82.66% with an average of 3 FPs per CT scan/case.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess variability of computed tomographic (CT) measurements of lesions of various sizes and margin sharpness in several organs taken by readers with different levels of experience, as would be found in routine clinical practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, 17 radiologists with varying levels of experience independently obtained bidimensional orthogonal axial measurements of 80 lymph nodes, 120 pulmonary lesions, and 120 hepatic lesions, categorized by size and margin sharpness. Repeat measurements were performed 2 or more weeks later. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess intra- and interobserver variability.
RESULTS: For long- and short-axis measurements, respectively, overall intraobserver agreement rates were 0.957 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.947, 0.966) and 0.945 (95% CI: 0.933, 0.955); interobserver agreement rates were 0.954 (95% CI: 0.943, 0.963) and 0.941 (95% CI: 0.929, 0.951). Both intra- and interobserver agreement differed by lesion size, margin sharpness, location, and reader experience. Agreement ranged from 0.847 to 0.886 for lesions 20 mm or larger versus 0.745-0.785 for lesions smaller than 10 mm, 0.961 to 0.975 for smooth margins versus 0.924-0.942 for irregular margins, 0.955 to 0.97 for lung lesions versus 0.884-0.94 for lymph nodes, and 0.95 to 0.97 for attending radiologists versus 0.928-0.945 for fellows. Measurement variability decreased with increasing lesion size; 95% limits of agreement for short-axis measurements were -11.6% to 6.7% for lesions smaller than 10 mm versus -6.2% to 4.7% for lesions 20 mm or larger.
CONCLUSION: Overall intra- and interobserver variability rates were similar; in clinical practice, serial CT measurements can be safely performed by different radiologists. Smooth margins, larger lesion size, and greater reader experience resulted in a higher consistency of measurements. Depending on lesion size, increases of 4%-6% or greater in long axis and 5%-7% or greater in short axis and decreases of -6% to -10% or greater in long axis and -6% to -12% or greater in short axis at CT can be considered true changes rather than measurement variation, with 95% confidence.},

@article{Zhao:2013aa,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Understanding magnitudes of variability when measuring tumor size may be valuable in improving detection of tumor change and thus evaluating tumor response to therapy in clinical trials and care. Our study explored intra- and inter-reader variability of tumor uni-dimensional (1D), bi-dimensional (2D), and volumetric (VOL) measurements using manual and computer-aided methods (CAM) on CT scans reconstructed at different slice intervals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Raw CT data from 30 patients enrolled in oncology clinical trials was reconstructed at 5, 2.5, and 1.25 mm slice intervals. 118 lesions in the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes were analyzed. For each lesion, two independent radiologists manually and, separately, using computer software, measured the maximum diameter (1D), maximum perpendicular diameter, and volume (CAM only). One of them blindly repeated the measurements. Intra- and inter-reader variability for the manual method and CAM were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models and Bland-Altman method.
RESULTS: For the three slice intervals, the maximum coefficients of variation for manual intra-/inter-reader variability were 6.9%/9.0% (1D) and 12.3%/18.0% (2D), and for CAM were 5.4%/9.3% (1D), 11.3%/18.8% (2D) and 9.3%/18.0% (VOL). Maximal 95% reference ranges for the percentage difference in intra-reader measurements for manual 1D and 2D, and CAM VOL were (-15.5%, 25.8%), (-27.1%, 51.6%), and (-22.3%, 33.6%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Variability in measuring the diameter and volume of solid tumors, manually and by CAM, is affected by CT slice interval. The 2.5mm slice interval provides the least measurement variability. Among the three techniques, 2D has the greatest measurement variability compared to 1D and 3D.},

Nuclear imaging techniques such as PET can be used to monitor drug pharmacokinetics and distribution and study specific molecular endpoints. In assessing drug efficacy, imaging biomarkers and imaging surrogate endpoints can be more objective and faster to measure than clinical outcomes, and allow small group sizes, quick results and good statistical power. Imaging also has important role in drug safety monitoring, particularly when there is no other suitable biomarkers available.

	abstract = {This paper describes a framework for establishing a reference airway tree segmentation, which was used to quantitatively evaluate fifteen different airway tree extraction algorithms in a standardized manner. Because of the sheer difficulty involved in manually constructing a complete reference standard from scratch, we propose to construct the reference using results from all algorithms that are to be evaluated. We start by subdividing each segmented airway tree into its individual branch segments. Each branch segment is then visually scored by trained observers to determine whether or not it is a correctly segmented part of the airway tree. Finally, the reference airway trees are constructed by taking the union of all correctly extracted branch segments. Fifteen airway tree extraction algorithms from different research groups are evaluated on a diverse set of twenty chest computed tomography (CT) scans of subjects ranging from healthy volunteers to patients with severe pathologies, scanned at different sites, with different CT scanner brands, models, and scanning protocols. Three performance measures covering different aspects of segmentation quality were computed for all participating algorithms. Results from the evaluation showed that no single algorithm could extract more than an average of 74% of the total length of all branches in the reference standard, indicating substantial differences between the algorithms. A fusion scheme that obtained superior results is presented, demonstrating that there is complementary information provided by the different algorithms and there is still room for further improvements in airway segmentation algorithms.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether measurement of the relative area of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than a certain threshold on thin-section computed tomographic (CT) scans obtained during expiration is a valuable method of quantifying the extent of pulmonary emphysema.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients underwent CT (with 1-mm collimation) preoperatively during inspiration and expiration. Relative areas of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than various thresholds were calculated. These relative areas were compared with areas found macroscopically to have emphysema (59 patients [51 men, eight women; aged 40-77 years]) and with two microscopic indices (35 patients [29 men, six women; aged 42-77 years]) assessed on the resected specimens.
RESULTS: The valid expiratory CT thresholds were found to be -820 and 910 HU for microscopic and macroscopic emphysema, respectively. However, results of stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that the inspiratory threshold of -950 HU was superior for both macroscopically and microscopically quantified emphysema. The correlation coefficients in expiratory CT were higher for the pulmonary volumes but similar for the diffusing capacity.
CONCLUSION: Expiratory quantitative CT is not as accurate as inspiratory CT for quantifying pulmonary emphysema and probably reflects air trapping more than reduction in the alveolar wall surface.},

	abstract = {In patients with airflow limitation caused by cigarette smoking, lung density measured by computed tomography is strongly correlated with quantitative pathology scores of emphysema, but the ability of lung densitometry to detect progression of emphysema is disputed. We assessed the sensitivity of lung densitometry as a parameter of disease progression of emphysema in comparison to FEV(1) and gas transfer. At study baseline and after 30 months we measured computed tomography (CT)-derived lung density, spirometry and carbon monoxide diffusion coefficient in 144 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in five different centers. Annual change in lung density was 1.31 g/L/year (CI 95%: -2.12 to -0.50 HU, p=0.0015, 39.5 mL/year (CI 95%: -100.0-21.0 mL, p=0.2) for FEV(1) (-39.5 mL) and 24.3 micromol/min/kPa/L/year for gas transfer (CI 95%: -61.0-12.5 micromol/min/kPa/L/year, p=0.2). Signal-to-noise ratio (mean change divided by standard error of the change) for the detection of annual change was 3.2 for lung densitometry, but 1.3 for both FEV(1) and gas diffusion. We conclude that detection of progression of emphysema was found to be 2.5-fold more sensitive using lung densitometry than by using currently recommended lung function parameters. Our results support CT scan as an efficacious test for novel drugs for emphysema.},

@article{Warfield:2004aa,
	abstract = {Characterizing the performance of image segmentation approaches has been a persistent challenge. Performance analysis is important since segmentation algorithms often have limited accuracy and precision. Interactive drawing of the desired segmentation by human raters has often been the only acceptable approach, and yet suffers from intra-rater and inter-rater variability. Automated algorithms have been sought in order to remove the variability introduced by raters, but such algorithms must be assessed to ensure they are suitable for the task. The performance of raters (human or algorithmic) generating segmentations of medical images has been difficult to quantify because of the difficulty of obtaining or estimating a known true segmentation for clinical data. Although physical and digital phantoms can be constructed for which ground truth is known or readily estimated, such phantoms do not fully reflect clinical images due to the difficulty of constructing phantoms which reproduce the full range of imaging characteristics and normal and pathological anatomical variability observed in clinical data. Comparison to a collection of segmentations by raters is an attractive alternative since it can be carried out directly on the relevant clinical imaging data. However, the most appropriate measure or set of measures with which to compare such segmentations has not been clarified and several measures are used in practice. We present here an expectation-maximization algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE). The algorithm considers a collection of segmentations and computes a probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation and a measure of the performance level represented by each segmentation. The source of each segmentation in the collection may be an appropriately trained human rater or raters, or may be an automated segmentation algorithm. The probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation is formed by estimating an optimal combination of the segmentations, weighting each segmentation depending upon the estimated performance level, and incorporating a prior model for the spatial distribution of structures being segmented as well as spatial homogeneity constraints. STAPLE is straightforward to apply to clinical imaging data, it readily enables assessment of the performance of an automated image segmentation algorithm, and enables direct comparison of human rater and algorithm performance.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To adapt the so-called nonlocal means filter to deal with magnetic resonance (MR) images with spatially varying noise levels (for both Gaussian and Rician distributed noise).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Most filtering techniques assume an equal noise distribution across the image. When this assumption is not met, the resulting filtering becomes suboptimal. This is the case of MR images with spatially varying noise levels, such as those obtained by parallel imaging (sensitivity-encoded), intensity inhomogeneity-corrected images, or surface coil-based acquisitions. We propose a new method where information regarding the local image noise level is used to adjust the amount of denoising strength of the filter. Such information is automatically obtained from the images using a new local noise estimation method.
RESULTS: The proposed method was validated and compared with the standard nonlocal means filter on simulated and real MRI data showing an improved performance in all cases.
CONCLUSION: The new noise-adaptive method was demonstrated to outperform the standard filter when spatially varying noise is present in the images.},

A diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness (DiReCT) measure is introduced where a continuous one-to-one correspondence between the gray matter-white matter interface and the estimated gray matter-cerebrospinal fluid interface is given by a diffeomorphic mapping in the image space. Thickness is then defined in terms of a distance measure between the interfaces of this sheet like structure. This technique also provides a natural way to compute continuous estimates of thickness within buried sulci by preventing opposing gray matter banks from intersecting. In addition, the proposed method incorporates neuroanatomical constraints on thickness values as part of the mapping process. Evaluation of this method is presented on synthetic images. As an application to brain images, a longitudinal study of thickness change in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorder is reported.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary x-ray computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research and development has been motivated, in part, by the quest to subphenotype common chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For thoracic CT and MRI, the main COPD research tools, disease biomarkers are being validated that go beyond anatomy and structure to include pulmonary functional measurements such as regional ventilation, perfusion, and inflammation. In addition, there has also been a drive to improve spatial and contrast resolution while at the same time reducing or eliminating radiation exposure. Therefore, this review focuses on our evolving understanding of patient-relevant and clinically important COPD endpoints and how current and emerging MRI and CT tools and measurements may be exploited for their identification, quantification, and utilization. Since reviews of the imaging physics of pulmonary CT and MRI and reviews of other COPD imaging methods were previously published and well-summarized, we focus on the current clinical challenges in COPD and the potential of newly emerging MR and CT imaging measurements to address them. Here we summarize MRI and CT imaging methods and their clinical translation for generating reproducible and sensitive measurements of COPD related to pulmonary ventilation and perfusion as well as parenchyma morphology. The key clinical problems in COPD provide an important framework in which pulmonary imaging needs to rapidly move in order to address the staggering burden, costs, as well as the mortality and morbidity associated with COPD.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Automated methods to quantify interstitial lung disease (ILD) on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans in people at risk for pulmonary fibrosis have not been developed and validated.
METHODS: Cohorts with familial pulmonary fibrosis (n = 126) or rheumatoid arthritis with and without ILD (n = 86) were used to develop and validate a computer program capable of quantifying ILD on HRCT scans, which imaged the lungs semicontinuously from the apices to the lung bases during end-inspiration in the prone position. This method uses segmentation, texture analysis, training, classification, and grading to score ILD.
RESULTS: Quantification of HRCT scan findings of ILD using an automated computer program correlated with radiologist readings and detected disease of varying severity in a derivation cohort with familial pulmonary fibrosis or their first-degree relatives. This algorithm was validated in an independent cohort of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis with and without ILD. Automated classification of HRCT scans as normal or ILD was significant in the derivation and validation cohorts (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves performed independently for each group were 0.888 for the derivation cohort and 0.885 for the validation cohort. Pulmonary function test results, including FVC and diffusion capacity, correlated with computer-generated HRCT scan scores for ILD (r = -0.483 and r = -0.532, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Automated computer scoring of HRCT scans can objectively identify ILD and potentially quantify radiographic severity of lung disease in populations at risk for pulmonary fibrosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computer analysis of high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans may improve the assessment of structural lung injury in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). The goal of this cross-sectional pilot study was to validate automated, observer-independent image analysis software to establish objective, simple criteria for bronchiectasis and air trapping.
METHODS: HRCT scans of the chest were performed in 35 children with CF and compared with scans from 12 disease control subjects. Automated image analysis software was developed to count visible airways on inspiratory images and to measure a low attenuation density (LAD) index on expiratory images. Among the children with CF, relationships among automated measures, Brody HRCT scanning scores, lung function, and sputum markers of inflammation were assessed.
RESULTS: The number of total, central, and peripheral airways on inspiratory images and LAD (%) on expiratory images were significantly higher in children with CF compared with control subjects. Among subjects with CF, peripheral airway counts correlated strongly with Brody bronchiectasis scores by two raters (r=0.86, P<.0001; r=0.91, P<.0001), correlated negatively with lung function, and were positively associated with sputum free neutrophil elastase activity. LAD (%) correlated with Brody air trapping scores (r=0.83, P<.0001; r=0.69, P<.0001) but did not correlate with lung function or sputum inflammatory markers.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative airway counts and LAD (%) on HRCT scans appear to be useful surrogates for bronchiectasis and air trapping in children with CF. Our automated methodology provides objective quantitative measures of bronchiectasis and air trapping that may serve as end points in CF clinical trials.},

@article{Qi:2014aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multi-detector Computed Tomography has become an invaluable tool for the diagnosis of chronic respiratory diseases. Based on CT images, the automatic algorithm to detect the fissures and divide the lung into five lobes will help regionally quantify, amongst others, the lung density, texture, airway and, blood vessel structures, ventilation and perfusion.
METHODS: Sagittal adaptive fissure scanning based on the sparseness of the vessels and bronchi is employed to localize the potential fissure region. Following a Hessian matrix based line enhancement filter in the coronal slice, the shortest path is determined by means of Uniform Cost Search. Implicit surface fitting based on Radial Basis Functions is used to extract the fissure surface for lobe segmentation. By three implicit fissure surface functions, the lung is divided into five lobes. The proposed algorithm is tested by 14 datasets. The accuracy is evaluated by the mean ($\pm$S.D.), root mean square, and the maximum of the shortest Euclidian distance from the manually-defined fissure surface to that extracted by the algorithm.
RESULTS: Averaged over all datasets, the mean ($\pm$S.D.), root mean square, and the maximum of the shortest Euclidian distance are 2.05 $\pm$ 1.80, 2.46 and 7.34 mm for the right oblique fissure. The measures are 2.77 $\pm$ 2.12, 3.13 and 7.75 mm for the right horizontal fissure, 2.31 $\pm$ 1.76, 3.25 and 6.83 mm for the left oblique fissure. The fissure detection works for the data with a small lung nodule nearby the fissure and a small lung subpleural nodule. The volume and emphysema index of each lobe can be calculated. The algorithm is very fast, e.g., to finish the fissure detection and fissure extension for the dataset with 320 slices only takes around 50 seconds.
CONCLUSIONS: The sagittal adaptive fissure scanning can localize the potential fissure regions quickly. After the potential region is enhanced by a Hessian based line enhancement filter, Uniform Cost Search can extract the fissures successfully in 2D. Surface fitting is able to obtain three implicit surface functions for each dataset. The current algorithm shows good accuracy, robustness and speed, may help locate the lesions into each lobe and analyze them regionally.},

	abstract = {The automated segmentation of vessel tree structures is a crucial preprocessing stage in computer aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes of interstitial lung disease (ILD) patterns in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). The accuracy of such preprocessing stages is expected to influence the accuracy of lung CAD schemes. Although algorithms aimed at improving the accuracy of lung fields segmentation in presence of ILD have been reported, the corresponding vessel tree segmentation stage is under-researched. Furthermore, previously reported vessel tree segmentation methods have only dealt with normal lung parenchyma. In this paper, an automated vessel tree segmentation scheme is proposed, adapted to the presence of pathologies affecting lung parenchyma. The first stage of the method accounts for a recently proposed method utilizing a 3-D multiscale vessel enhancement filter based on eigenvalue analysis of the Hessian matrix and on unsupervised segmentation. The second stage of the method is a texture-based voxel classification refinement to correct possible over-segmentation. The performance of the proposed scheme, and of the previously reported technique, in vessel tree segmentation was evaluated by means of area overlap (previously reported: 0.715 $\pm$ 0.082, proposed: 0.931 $\pm$ 0.027), true positive fraction (previously reported: 0.968 $\pm$ 0.019, proposed: 0.935 $\pm$ 0.036) and false positive fraction (previously reported: 0.400 $\pm$ 0.181, proposed: 0.074 $\pm$ 0.031) on a dataset of 210 axial slices originating from seven ILD affected patient scans (used for performance evaluation out of 15). The proposed method demonstrated a statistically significantly ( p < 0.05) higher performance as compared to the previously reported vessel tree segmentation technique. The impact of suboptimal vessel tree segmentation in a reticular pattern quantification system is also demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Vessel tree reconstruction in volumetric data is a necessary prerequisite in various medical imaging applications. Specifically, when considering the application of automated lung nodule detection in thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans, vessel trees can be used to resolve local ambiguities based on global considerations and so improve the performance of nodule detection algorithms. In this study, a novel approach to vessel tree reconstruction and its application to nodule detection in thoracic CT scans was developed by using correlation-based enhancement filters and a fuzzy shape representation of the data. The proposed correlation-based enhancement filters depend on first-order partial derivatives and so are less sensitive to noise compared with Hessian-based filters. Additionally, multiple sets of eigenvalues are used so that a distinction between nodules and vessel junctions becomes possible. The proposed fuzzy shape representation is based on regulated morphological operations that are less sensitive to noise. Consequently, the vessel tree reconstruction algorithm can accommodate vessel bifurcation and discontinuities. A quantitative performance evaluation of the enhancement filters and of the vessel tree reconstruction algorithm was performed. Moreover, the proposed vessel tree reconstruction algorithm reduced the number of false positives generated by an existing nodule detection algorithm by 38%.},

	abstract = {Remarkable advances in computed tomography (CT) technology geared our research toward investigating the integrative function of the lung and the development of a database of the airway tree incorporating anatomical and functional data with computational models. As part of this project, we are developing the algorithm to construct an anatomically realistic geometric model of airways from CT images. The basic concept of the algorithm is to segment as many airway trees as possible from CT images and later correct quantified parameters based on CT values. CT images are acquired with a 64-channel multidetector CT, and the airway is then extracted from them by the region-growing method while maintaining connectivity. Using this method, we extracted 428 airways up to the 14th branching generation. Although the airway diameters up to the 4th generation showed good agreement with those reported in an autopsy study, those in later generations were all greater than the reported values because of the limited resolution of the CT images. We corrected the errors in diameters by assessing the relationship between the diameter and median value of Hounsfield unit (HU) intensity of each airway; consequently, the diameters up to generation 8 agreed well with the reported values. Based on these results, we conclude that the use of HU-based correction algorithm combined with rough segmentation can be another way to improve data accuracy in the morphometric analysis of airways from CTs.},

	abstract = {We developed and tested a fully automated computerized scheme that identifies pulmonary airway sections depicted on computed tomography (CT) images and computes their sizes including the lumen and airway wall areas. The scheme includes four processing modules that (1) segment left and right lung areas, (2) identify airway locations, (3) segment airway walls from neighboring pixels, and (4) compute airway sizes. The scheme uses both a raster scanning and a labeling algorithm complemented by simple classification rules for region size and circularity to automatically search for and identify airway sections of interest. A profile tracking method is used to segment airway walls from neighboring pixels including those associated with dense tissue (i.e., pulmonary arteries) along scanning radial rays. A partial pixel membership method is used to compute airway size. The scheme was tested on ten randomly selected CT studies that included 26 sets of CT images acquired using both low and conventional dose CT examinations with one of four reconstruction algorithms (namely, "bone," "lung," "soft," and "standard" convolution kernels). Three image section thicknesses (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mm) were evaluated. The scheme detected a large number of quantifiable airway sections when the CT images were reconstructed using high spatial frequency convolution kernels. The detection results demonstrated a consistent trend for all test image sets in that as airway lumen size increases, on average the airway wall area increases as well and the wall area percentage decreases. The study suggested that CT images reconstructed using high spatial frequency convolution kernels and thin-section thickness were most amenable to automated detection, reasonable segmentation, and quantified assessment when the airways are close to being perpendicular to the CT image plane.},

Conventional lung segmentation methods rely on large attenuation differences between lung parenchyma and surrounding tissue. These methods fail in scans where dense abnormalities are present, which often occurs in clinical data. Some methods to handle these situations have been proposed, but they are too time consuming or too specialized to be used in clinical practice. In this article, a new hybrid lung segmentation method is presented that automatically detects failures of a conventional algorithm and, when needed, resorts to a more complex algorithm, which is expected to produce better results in abnormal cases. In a large quantitative evaluation on a database of 150 scans from different sources, the hybrid method is shown to perform substantially better than a conventional approach at a relatively low increase in computational cost.},

@article{Wang:2009aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Accurate segmentation of lungs with severe interstitial lung disease (ILD) in thoracic computed tomography (CT) is an important and difficult task in the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Therefore, we developed in this study a texture analysis-based method for accurate segmentation of lungs with severe ILD in multidetector CT scans.
METHODS: Our database consisted of 76 CT scans, including 31 normal cases and 45 abnormal cases with moderate or severe ILD. The lungs in three selected slices for each CT scan were first manually delineated by a medical physicist, and then confirmed or revised by an expert chest radiologist, and they were used as the reference standard for lung segmentation. To segment the lungs, we first employed a CT value thresholding technique to obtain an initial lung estimate, including normal and mild ILD lung parenchyma. We then used texture-feature images derived from the co-occurrence matrix to further identify abnormal lung regions with severe ILD. Finally, we combined the identified abnormal lung regions with the initial lungs to generate the final lung segmentation result. The overlap rate, volume agreement, mean absolute distance (MAD), and maximum absolute distance (dmax) between the automatically segmented lungs and the reference lungs were employed to evaluate the performance of the segmentation method.
RESULTS: Our segmentation method achieved a mean overlap rate of 96.7%, a mean volume agreement of 98.5%, a mean MAD of 0.84 mm, and a mean dmax of 10.84 mm for all the cases in our database; a mean overlap rate of 97.7%, a mean volume agreement of 99.0%, a mean MAD of 0.66 mm, and a mean dmax of 9.59 mm for the 31 normal cases; and a mean overlap rate of 96.1%, a mean volume agreement of 98.1%, a mean MAD of 0.96 mm, and a mean dmax of 11.71 mm for the 45 abnormal cases with ILD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our lung segmentation method provided accurate segmentation results for abnormal CT scans with severe ILD and would be useful for developing CAD systems for quantification, detection, and diagnosis of ILD.},

@article{Prasad:2008aa,
	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Segmentation of lungs using high-resolution computer tomographic images in the setting of diffuse lung diseases is a major challenge in medical image analysis. Threshold-based techniques tend to leave out lung regions that have increased attenuation, such as in the presence of interstitial lung disease. In contrast, streak artifacts can cause the lung segmentation to "leak" into the chest wall. The purpose of this work was to perform segmentation of the lungs using a technique that selects an optimal threshold for a given patient by comparing the curvature of the lung boundary to that of the ribs.
METHODS: Our automated technique goes beyond fixed threshold-based approaches to include lung boundary curvature features. One would expect the curvature of the ribs and the curvature of the lung boundary around the ribs to be very close. Initially, the ribs are segmented by applying a threshold algorithm followed by morphologic operations. The lung segmentation scheme uses a multithreshold iterative approach. The threshold value is verified until the curvature of the ribs and the curvature of the lung boundary are closely matched. The curve of the ribs is represented using polynomial interpolation, and the lung boundary is matched in such a way that there is minimal deviation from this representation. Performance of this technique was compared with conventional (fixed threshold) lung segmentation techniques on 25 subjects using a volumetric overlap fraction measure.
RESULTS: The performance of the rib segmentation technique was significantly different from conventional techniques with an average higher mean volumetric overlap fraction of about 5%.
CONCLUSIONS: The technique described here allows for accurate quantification of volumetric computed tomography and more advanced segmentation of abnormal areas.},

	abstract = {A fully automated and three-dimensional (3D) segmentation method for the identification of the pulmonary parenchyma in thorax X-ray computed tomography (CT) datasets is proposed. It is meant to be used as pre-processing step in the computer-assisted detection (CAD) system for malignant lung nodule detection that is being developed by the Medical Applications in a Grid Infrastructure Connection (MAGIC-5) Project. In this new approach the segmentation of the external airways (trachea and bronchi), is obtained by 3D region growing with wavefront simulation and suitable stop conditions, thus allowing an accurate handling of the hilar region, notoriously difficult to be segmented. Particular attention was also devoted to checking and solving the problem of the apparent 'fusion' between the lungs, caused by partial-volume effects, while 3D morphology operations ensure the accurate inclusion of all the nodules (internal, pleural, and vascular) in the segmented volume. The new algorithm was initially developed and tested on a dataset of 130 CT scans from the Italung-CT trial, and was then applied to the ANODE09-competition images (55 scans) and to the LIDC database (84 scans), giving very satisfactory results. In particular, the lung contour was adequately located in 96% of the CT scans, with incorrect segmentation of the external airways in the remaining cases. Segmentation metrics were calculated that quantitatively express the consistency between automatic and manual segmentations: the mean overlap degree of the segmentation masks is 0.96 $\pm$ 0.02, and the mean and the maximum distance between the mask borders (averaged on the whole dataset) are 0.74 $\pm$ 0.05 and 4.5 $\pm$ 1.5, respectively, which confirms that the automatic segmentations quite correctly reproduce the borders traced by the radiologist. Moreover, no tissue containing internal and pleural nodules was removed in the segmentation process, so that this method proved to be fit for the use in the framework of a CAD system. Finally, in the comparison with a two-dimensional segmentation procedure, inter-slice smoothness was calculated, showing that the masks created by the 3D algorithm are significantly smoother than those calculated by the 2D-only procedure.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a postprocessing tool to quantify ventilated split-lung volumes on the basis of (3)He-MRI and to apply it in patients after single-lung transplantation (SLTX). High-resolution CT (HRCT) was employed as a reference modality providing split air-filled lung volumes. Lung volumes derived from pulmonary function test results served as clinical parameters and were used as the "gold standard."
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight patients (mean age, 54 years) with emphysema and six patients (mean age, 58 years) with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. All patients were evaluated following SLTX. HRCT was performed during inspiration (slice thickness, 1 mm; increment, 10 mm). For correlation with (3)He-MRI, HRCT images were reconstructed in coronal orientation to match the same anatomic levels. Aerated lung was determined by threshold-based segmentation of CT. (3)He-MRI was performed on a 1.5-T scanner using a two-dimensional, fast low-angle shot sequence in coronal orientation covering the whole lung after inhalation of a 300-mL bolus of hyperpolarized (3)He gas followed by normal room air for the rest of the tidal volume. Lung segmentation on (3)He-MRI was done using different thresholds.
RESULTS: In emphysematous patients, (3)He-MRI showed excellent correlation (r = 0.9) with vital capacity, while CT correlated (r = 0.8) with total lung capacity. (3)He-MRI correlated well with CT (r > 0.8) for grafts and native fibrotic lungs. In emphysematous lungs, MRI showed a good correlation (r = 0.7) with the nonemphysematous lung volume from CT. Increasing thresholds in (3)He-MRI reveal differences between aerated and ventilated lung areas with a different distribution in emphysema and fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: (3)He-MRI is superior to CT in emphysema to demonstrate ventilated lung areas that participate in gas exchange. In fibrosis, (3)He-MRI and CT have a similar impact. The decrease pattern and the intraindividual ratio between ventilation of native and transplanted lungs will have to be investigated as a new surrogate for the ventilatory follow-up in patients undergoing SLTX.},

Using an advanced dedicated semiautomatic analysis tool, the functional inspiratory/expiratory shifts of emphysema volume and clusters were quantified. The pulmonary function test (PFT) served as the clinical "gold standard."
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients (9 women and 22 men; mean [+/- SD] age, 60 +/- 8 years) who had severe emphysema due to COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] class III and IV) were included in the study. All patients underwent paired inspiratory/expiratory multidetector CT scans (slice thickness, 1/0.8 mm) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). CT scan data were analyzed with self-written emphysema detection solftware. It provides lung volume (LV), emphysema volume (EV), emphysema index (EI), and four clusters of emphysema with different volumes (from 2, 8, 65, and 120 mm(3)). These results were correlated with total lung capacity (TLC), intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV), and residual volume (RV) derived from PFT results.
RESULTS: Inspiratory LV correlated with TLC (r = 0.9), expiratory LV with ITGV (r = 0.87), and RV (r = 0.83). Expiratory EV correlated better with ITGV (r = 0.88) and RV (r = 0.93) than with inspiratory EV (r = 0.83 and 0.88, respectively). The mean inspiratory EI was 54 +/- 13%, and it decreased to 43 +/- 15% in expiration. However, the individuals showed a broad spectrum of changes of EI (mean, 11%; range, 1 to 28%), and no differences in inspiratory/expiratory EI and changes in EI or LV were found between GOLD III and GOLD IV patients. In expiration, there was a change from the large emphysema cluster (-37%) to the intermediate cluster (+15%) and small cluster (+13% and +11%, respectively). The change of volume of the large emphysema cluster after expiration correlated well with the changes in LV (r = 0.9), EV (r = 0.99), EI (r = 0.85), and MLD (r = 0.76).
CONCLUSION: Emphysema volumes measured from expiratory MDCT scans better reflect PFT abnormalities in patients with severe emphysema than those from inspiratory scans. Volumetric cluster analysis provided deeper insights into the local hyperinflation and expiratory obstruction of large emphysematous clusters.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effect of radiation dose and scanner manufacturer on quantitative CT scan measurements of lung morphology in smokers.
METHODS: Low-dose and high-dose, inspiratory, multislice CT scans were obtained in 50 subjects at intervals of approximately 6 months (mean [+/- SD] interval, 0.5 +/- 0.2 years). In another 30 subjects, multislice CT scans were acquired first using a GE LightSpeed Ultra (General Electric Healthcare; Milwaukee, WI), followed a mean time of 1.2 +/- 0.4 years later by using a Siemens Sensation 16 scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions; Erlangen, Germany). Custom software was used to measure lung volume, mass, mean density, and the extent of emphysema using threshold cutoffs of -950, -910, and -856 Hounsfield units (HU) and the lowest 15th and 5th percentile points.
RESULTS: The change in radiograph dose significantly affected measurements of emphysema assessed using mean lung density, threshold, or percentile methods. There were also interactions between dose and total lung volume for all of the measurements except the -950-HU threshold and the lowest fifth percentile point. These two emphysema measurements suggest that there was more emphysema found in the CT scans obtained using a lower radiograph dose. Only the mean lung density and -856-HU threshold showed significant effects between CT scanner manufacturers and interactions between total lung volume and scanner. All other measures of lung structure were not different between the two CT scanners.
CONCLUSION: CT scan measurements of very low density lung structures are significantly affected by radiation dose but are less sensitive to the lung volume. Image acquisition parameters including radiation dose, scanner type, and the subject's breath size should be standardized to estimate emphysema severity in longitudinal studies.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Computer-aided detection algorithms applied to multidetector row CT (MDCT) lung image data sets have the potential to significantly alter clinical practice through the early, quantitative detection of pulmonary pathology. In this project, we have further developed a computer-aided detection tool, the adaptive multiple feature method (AMFM), for the detection of interstitial lung diseases based on MDCT-generated volumetric data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed MDCT (Siemens Sensation 16 or 64 120 kV, B50f convolution kernel, and <or=0.75-mm slice thickness) on 20 human volunteers recruited from four cohorts studied under an National Institutes of Health-sponsored Bioengineering Research Partnership Grant: 1) normal never smokers; 2) normal smokers; 3) those with emphysema, and 4) those with interstitial lung disease (total: 11 males, 9 females; age range 20-75 years, mean age 40 years). A total of 1,184 volumes of interest (VOIs; 21 x 21 pixels in plane) were marked by a senior radiologist and a senior pulmonologist as emphysema (EMPH, n = 287); ground-glass (GG, n = 147), honeycombing (HC, n = 137), normal nonsmokers (NN, n = 287), and normal smokers (NS, n = 326). For each VOI, we calculated 24 volumetric features, including statistical features (first-order features, run-length, and co-occurrence features), histogram, and fractal features. We compared two methods of classification (a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Bayesian classifier) using a 10-fold cross validation method and McNemar's test.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of five patterns in the form of Bayesian/SVM was: EMPH: 91/93%; GG: 89/86%; HC: 93/90%; NN: 90/73%; and NS: 75/82%. The specificity of five patterns in the form of Bayesian/support vector machine was: EMPH: 98/98%; GG: 98/98%; HC: 99/99%; NN: 90/94%; and NS: 96/91%.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that volumetric features including statistical features, histogram and fractal features can be successfully used in differentiation of parenchymal pathology associated with both emphysema and interstitial lung diseases. Additionally, support vector machine and Bayesian methods are comparable classifiers for characterization of interstitial lung diseases on MDCT images.},

	abstract = {Our goal is to enhance the ability to differentiate normal lung from subtle pathologies via multidetector row CT (MDCT) by extending a two-dimensional (2-D) texturebased tissue classification [adaptive multiple feature method (AMFM)] to use three-dimensional (3-D) texture features. We performed MDCT on 34 humans and classified volumes of interest (VOIs) in the MDCT images into five categories: EC, emphysema in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); MC, mild emphysema in mild COPD; NC, normal appearing lung in mild COPD; NN, normal appearing lung in normal nonsmokers; and NS, normal appearing lung in normal smokers. COPD severity was based upon pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Airways and vessels were excluded from VOIs; 24 3-D texture features were calculated; and a Bayesian classifier was used for discrimination. A leave-one-out method was employed for validation. Sensitivity of the four-class classification in the form of 3-D/2-D was: EC: 85%/71%, MC: 90%/82%; NC: 88%/50%; NN: 100%/60%. Sensitivity and specificity for NN using a two-class classification of NN and NS in the form of 3-D/2-D were: 99%/72% and 100%/75%, respectively. We conclude that 3-D AMFM analysis of lung parenchyma improves discrimination compared to 2-D AMFM of the same VOIs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the 3-D AMFM may provide a means of discriminating subtle differences between smokers and nonsmokers both with normal PFTs.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To use a combination of helium-3 (3-He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton single-shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) to compare ventilated lung volumes in groups of "healthy" smokers, smokers diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and never-smokers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All study participants were assessed with spirometry prior to imaging. 3-He images were collected during an arrested breath hold, after inhaling a mixture of 200 mL of hyperpolarized 3-He/800 mL of N2. Proton SSFSE images were acquired after inhaling 1 liter of room air. The ventilated volume for each study participant was calculated from the 3-He images, and a ratio was calculated to give a percentage ventilated lung volume.
RESULTS: Never-smokers exhibited a 90% mean ventilated volume. The mean ventilated lung volumes for healthy smokers and smokers diagnosed with COPD were 75.2% and 67.6%, respectively. No correlation with spirometry was demonstrated for either of the smoking groups.
CONCLUSION: Combined 3-He/Proton SSFSE MRI of the lungs is a noninvasive method, using nonionizing radiation, which demonstrates ventilated airspaces and enables the calculation of ventilated lung volumes. This method appears to be sensitive to early obstructive changes in the lungs of smokers.},

	abstract = {A method was devised to computationally segment and measure three-dimensional pulmonary trees in situ. Bronchi and pulmonary vessels were computationally extracted from volumetric computed tomography data based on radiopacity differences between airway wall and airway lumen and between blood and parenchyma, respectively. The tree was reduced to a central axis to facilitate measurement of branch segment length and angle. Cross-sectional area was measured on a reconstructed computed tomography slice perpendicular to this central axis. The method was validated by scanning two Plexiglas phantoms and an intact lung. Reconstructed diameters in the phantoms were accurate for branches > 2 mm. In the lung airway branches between 1 and 2 mm in diameter were often unresolved when their angle of orientation with respect to the axis of the scanner was > 45 degrees. However, if a branch was resolved, its reconstructed diameter was little affected by orientation. This method represents a significant improvement in the analysis of complex pulmonary structures in three dimensions.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that diffuse and/or focal air trapping are sensitive indicators of airflow obstruction in smoker's small airways disease, when age, gender and presence of emphysematous lesions were allowed for.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-eight smokers and 34 never smokers, recruited from a randomized population study of men born in 1933, were investigated by HRCT and by extended pulmonary function tests, including a sensitive test for small airways disease (N2 slope). Diffuse air trapping was evaluated by calculating a quotient of mean lung density at expiration and inspiration. Focal air trapping was scored visually by consensus.
RESULTS: Diffuse air trapping did not differ between non-emphysematous smokers and never smokers. Furthermore, diffuse air trapping correlated well to the quotient between the residual volume and total lung capacity (RV/TLC, p = 0.01) and was consequently higher in emphysematous smokers than in never smokers. Focal air trapping was found as frequently in smokers without emphysema as in never smokers. Smokers with emphysema showed significantly less focal air trapping. Neither the N2 slope nor any of the other lung function variables differed between those with and without focal air trapping among non-emphysematous smokers.
CONCLUSION: Neither diffuse nor focal air trapping are sensitive indicators of smoker's small airways disease.},

	abstract = {A texture-based adaptive multiple feature method (AMFM) for evaluating pulmonary parenchyma from computed tomography (CT) images is described. This method incorporates multiple statistical and fractal texture features. The AMFM was compared to two previously published methods, namely, mean lung density (MLD) and the lowest fifth percentile of the histogram (HIST). First, the ability of these methods to detect subtle differences in ventral-dorsal lung density gradient in the prone normal lung was studied. Second, their abilities to differentiate between normal and emphysematous whole lung slices were compared. Finally, regional analyses comparing normal and emphysematous regions were performed by dividing the lungs. In the CT slices into six equal regions, ventral to dorsal, and analyzing each region separately. The results demonstrated that the AMFM could separate the ventral from the dorsal one-third of the normal prone lung with 89.8% accuracy, compared to an accuracy of 74.6% with the MLD and 64.4% with the HIST methods. The normal and emphysematous slices were separated on a global basis with 100.0% accuracy using the AMFM as compared to an accuracy of 94.7% and 97.4% using the MLD and HIST methods, respectively. The regional normal and emphysematous tissues were discriminated with an average accuracy of 97.9%, 89.9%, and 99.1% with the AMFM, MLD, and HIST methods, respectively. The three methods and the pulmonary function tests in the normal and emphysema groups were poorly correlated. Quantitative texture analysis using adaptive multiple features holds promise for the objective noninvasive evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma.},

In the first two readings, when the observers were blinded to the primary diagnosis of the subject, the average computer versus observer agreement was 44.4 +/- 8.7% and 47.3 +/- 9.0%, respectively. The average interobserver agreement for the same two readings were 48.8 +/- 9.1% and 52.2 +/- 10.0%, respectively.

	abstract = {We aimed to determine the degree and extent of parenchymal abnormalities on pulmo-CT in patients with emphysema. The study group consisted of 29 patients (18 male, 11 female; mean age 57.9+/-13). The diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, pulmonary function tests (PFT) values, and chest CT findings. All of the patients CT scans were obtained during suspended deep inspiration from the apices to the costophrenic angles. The mean lung attenuation (MLD) and parenchymal abnormalities related to emphysema were quantitatively calculated with tables, histograms and graphics at the whole lung. The lung density measurements revealed a mean density of -898.48+/-51.37 HU in patients with emphysema and -825.1+/-25.5 HU in control group. In addition, mean percentage of subthreshold attenuation values was found as 12.03+/-15.75 and 1.07+/-0.83 in patients with emphysema and control group, respectively. Compared with control group, the patients with emphysema had a significantly lower inspiratory MLD (p<0.05). Additionally, statistically significant correlations were seen between the MLD and percentage of subthreshold values (r=0.44, p<0.05). In contrast, there was poor correlation between PFT measurements and the subthreshold values. In conclusion, pulmo-CT is a quick, simple method for quantitative confirmation of the presence of parenchymal abnormalities of lung as mosaic attenuation and should be used in combination with other radiological methods and PFT as it gives additional information to routine examinations in patients with emphysema.},

	abstract = {Currently, lung densitometry for the assessment of pulmonary emphysema has been fully validated against pathology, pulmonary function, and health status, and it is therefore being applied in pharmacotherapeutic trials. Nevertheless, its application for the early detection of emphysema has not yet been introduced in daily clinical practice. The main reason for this is the fact that it is not yet regarded a fully optimized and standardized technique. In this work, an overview is given on the current status of different standardization aspects that play an important role in this, ie, image acquisition, choice of densitometric parameter and image processing. To address these issues, solutions have been sought from the literature and from original data from previous studies. Standardization and optimization of lung densitometry has reached a more advanced stage than has been reported so far. If normal values will become available, this technique will be feasible for clinical practice. As a result, standardization for the detection and assessment of other density-related lung diseases can be achieved in a shorter period of time.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare objective and subjective assessment of the distribution of emphysema in unselected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 167 patients were computed tomography (CT) scanned, and the relative area (RA-910) of emphysema in each CT slice was plotted against table position. The craniocaudal distribution was calculated as the slope of the regression line, and grouped as upper-lung-zone predominance (ULP), lower-lung-zone predominance (LLP), or mild/homogeneous distribution (MHE). CT scans were also classified as ULP, LLP, and MHE based on visual assessment of three high-resolution CT (HRCT) slices, and the leading pattern of emphysema was classified as centrilobular (CLE), paraseptal (PSE), panlobular (PLE), or no emphysema (NE).
RESULTS: By objective classification, scans were divided into almost equal numbers of ULP, LLP, and MHE, whereas visual evaluation classified more scans as ULP (P<0.001) and very few as LLP (P<0.0001). In patients with CLE, 49% had ULP by objective classification, whereas LLP was the commonest leading pattern in PSE, PLE, and NE.
CONCLUSION: We found significant discrepancies between the objective and subjective distributions of emphysema in various morphological patterns, which may be of clinical importance in, for instance, lung-volume-reduction surgery.},

The method has the advantage that it can be applied at an early stage in an automated data analysis, before a tissue model is available. Described as nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3), the method is independent of pulse sequence and insensitive to pathological data that might otherwise violate model assumptions. To eliminate the dependence of the field estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is employed to estimate both the multiplicative bias field and the distribution of the true tissue intensities.

	abstract = {A crucial component of research on brain evolution has been the comparison of fossil endocranial surfaces with modern human and primate endocrania. The latter have generally been obtained by creating endocasts out of rubber latex shells filled with plaster. The extent to which the method of production introduces errors in endocast replicas is unknown. We demonstrate a powerful method of comparing complex shapes in 3-dimensions (3D) that is broadly applicable to a wide range of paleoanthropological questions. Pairs of virtual endocasts (VEs) created from high-resolution CT scans of corresponding latex/plaster endocasts and their associated crania were rigidly registered (aligned) in 3D space for two Homo sapiens and two Pan troglodytes specimens. Distances between each cranial VE and its corresponding latex/plaster VE were then mapped on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The results show that between 79.7% and 91.0% of the voxels in the four latex/plaster VEs are within 2 mm of their corresponding cranial VEs surfaces. The average error is relatively small, and variation in the pattern of error across the surfaces appears to be generally random overall. However, inferior areas around the cranial base and the temporal poles were somewhat overestimated in both human and chimpanzee specimens, and the area overlaying Broca's area in humans was somewhat underestimated. This study gives an idea of the size of possible error inherent in latex/plaster endocasts, indicating the level of confidence we can have with studies relying on comparisons between them and, e.g., hominid fossil endocasts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imaging of gas distribution in the lungs of patients with asthma has been restricted because of the lack of a suitable gaseous contrast agent. Hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe3) provides a new technique for magnetic resonance imaging of lung diseases.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the use of HHe3 gas to image the lungs of patients with moderate or severe asthma and to assess changes in gas distribution after methacholine and exercise challenge.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in asthmatic patients immediately after inhalation of HHe3 gas. In addition, images were obtained before and after methacholine challenge and a standard exercise test.
RESULTS: Areas of the lung with no signal or sharply reduced HHe3 signal (ventilation defects) are common in patients with asthma, and the number of defects was inversely related to the percent predicted FEV(1) (r = 0.71, P <.002). After methacholine challenge (n = 3), the number of defects increased. Similarly, imaging of the lungs after exercise (n = 6) showed increased ventilation defects in parallel with decreases in FEV(1). The increase in defects after challenge in these 9 asthmatic patients was significant both for the number (P <.02) and extent (P <.02) of the defects. The variability and speed of changes in ventilation and the complete lack of signal in many areas is in keeping with a model in which the defects result from airway closure.
CONCLUSION: HHe3 magnetic resonance provides a new technique for imaging the distribution of inhaled air in the lungs. The technique is suitable for following responses to treatment of asthma and changes after methacholine or exercise challenge.},

There has been considerable interest in measuring intrathoracic airways in two-dimensional (2-D) slices from volumetric X-ray computed tomography (CT). Such measurements can be used to evaluate and track the progression of diseases affecting the airways. A popular airway measurement method uses the "half-max" criteria, in which the gray level at the airway wall is estimated to be halfway between the minimum and maximum gray levels along a ray crossing the edge. However, because the scanning process introduces blurring, the half-max approach may not be applicable across all airway sizes. We propose a new measurement method based on a model of the scanning process. In our approach, we examine the gray-level profile of a ray crossing the airway wall and use a maximum-likelihood method to estimate the airway inner and outer radius. Using CT scans of a physical phantom, we present results showing that the new approach is more accurate than the half-max method at estimating wall location for thin-walled airways.},

This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: CT estimates of lung density have been used to estimate the extent and severity of emphysema. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that quantitative CT can track the changes that occur in diffuse lung disease.
DESIGN: The study was based on five patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) who underwent lung lavage. Pulmonary function was measured before and after each individual lung lavage, and the CT scans before and after lavage were used to compare total lung volume, airspace volume, lung weight, and regional lung inflation. The dry weight of proteinaceous material lavaged from the lung was measured and compared to the change in CT lung weight.
RESULTS: All the patients showed improvements in dyspnea, percentage of predicted diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and FVC. There was no change in CT-measured total lung volume or airspace volume, but there was a reduction in lung weight following lavage (p = 0.001), which correlated with the dry weight of the lavage effluent (R(2) = 0.73). Therefore, there was a shift in the regional lung inflation toward a more inflated lung with a corresponding increase in the mean lung inflation (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These data show that quantitative CT can objectively track the changes in lung weight and airspace inflation produced by a standard intervention in PAP, and we postulate that it can provide similar information about the progression of other diffuse lung diseases.},

Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues).

The reproducibility of 3He ADC and ventilation defects was also assessed in subjects scanned 3 times, twice within 10 minutes, and again within 7 +/- 2 days of the first MRI visit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperpolarized 3He MRI was performed in 6 subjects. Two interleaved images with and without additional diffusion sensitization were acquired with the first image serving as a ventilation image from which defect score and volume were measured and the combination of the 2 images used to compute ADC maps and ADC histograms.
RESULTS: He MRI at 3.0 Tesla showed increased mean ADC and ADC standard deviation for subjects with COPD compared with healthy volunteers (ADC healthy volunteer (0.24 +/- 0.12 cm2/s), mild-moderate COPD (0.34 +/- 0.14 cm2/s), and severe COPD (0.47 +/- 0.21 cm2/s), and these values were similar to previously reported results acquired at 1.5 Tesla. Reproducibility of mean ADC was high (coefficient of variation 2% in severe COPD, 3% in mild-moderate COPD, 4% in healthy volunteers) across all 3 scans. Higher same-day scan reproducibility was observed for ventilation defect volume compared with 1-week scan reproducibility in this small group of subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: ADC values for emphysematous lungs were significantly increased compared with healthy lungs in age-matched subjects, and all values were comparable to those reported previously at 1.5 Tesla. Ventilation defect score and ventilation defect volume results were also comparable to results previously reported in COPD subjects Reproducibility of ADC for same-day scan-rescan and 7-day rescan was high and similar to previously reported results.},

We have previously reported an automated rule-based method for extraction of airway trees from 3-D CT images using a priori knowledge about airway-tree anatomy. Although the method's sensitivity was quite good, its specificity suffered from a large number of falsely detected airways. We present a new approach to airway-tree detection based on fuzzy logic that increases the method's specificity without compromising its sensitivity. The method was validated in 32 CT image slices randomly selected from five volumetric canine electron-beam CT data sets. The fuzzy-logic method significantly outperformed the previously reported rule-based method (p < 0.002).},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate airway wall thickness and lung attenuation at spirometrically gated thin-section computed tomography (CT) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to correlate gated CT findings with pulmonary function test (PFT) results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethical committee approved the study, and all patients gave informed consent. Forty-two consecutive patients with COPD (20 with and 22 without chronic bronchitis [CB]) underwent gated thin-section CT and PFTs on the same day. The percentage wall area (PWA) and the thickness-to-diameter ratio (TDR) for all depicted bronchi that were round and larger than 2 mm in diameter, the mean lung attenuation (MLA), and the pixel index (PI) at -950 HU were determined. The reproducibility of the airway measurements was preliminarily tested by performing a five-trial examination in a patient with COPD and in a control patient. Differences in airway and lung attenuation measurements between the patients with and those without CB were evaluated at Mann-Whitney U testing. Simple and multiple regression analyses were used to assess the correlation between thin-section CT and PFT measurements.
RESULTS: The mean intraoperator coefficient of variation for airway measurements was 7.8% (range, 3.8%-13.4%). An average of nine bronchi per patient were assessed. Patients with CB had significantly higher PWAs, TDRs, and MLAs and significantly lower PIs than patients without CB (P < .05 for all values). The combination of PWA, TDR, and PWA normalized to body weight correlated significantly (P < .05) with the forced expiratory volume in 1 second-to-slow vital capacity ratio and the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide in patients with but not in patients without CB. PFT results correlated better with MLA and PI in patients without CB.
CONCLUSION: Bronchial wall measurements differ between patients who have COPD with CB and those who have COPD without CB. The correlation between airway dimensions and indexes of airway obstruction in patients with COPD and CB indicates that the bronchial tree is the site of anatomic-functional alterations in this patient group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The low attenuation areas on computed tomographic (CT) scans have been reported to represent emphysematous changes of the lung. However, the regional distribution of emphysema between the inner and outer segments of the lung has not been adequately studied. In this study the regional distribution of low attenuation areas has been compared by quantitative CT analysis and the contribution of the regional distribution to pulmonary function tests evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: Chest CT images and the results of pulmonary function tests were obtained from 73 patients with COPD. The lung images were divided into inner and outer segments in the upper (cranial), middle, and lower (caudal) sections. The percentage ratio of low attenuation area to corresponding lung area (LAA%) was then calculated. The LAA% of each segment was also compared with the results of pulmonary function tests.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) LAA% of the inner segment was 39.1 (18.5) compared with 28.1 (13.2) for the outer segment (p<0.0001). Linear and multiple regression analyses revealed that airflow limitation is closely correlated with the inner segment LAA% of the lower lung. In contrast, the carbon monoxide transfer factor is closely correlated with the inner segment LAA% of the upper lung.
CONCLUSION: Low attenuation areas on CT scans are more often found in the inner segment of the lung than in the outer segment, and the contribution of the inner segment to pulmonary function tests may be greater than the outer segment.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by the presence of airflow obstruction caused by emphysema or airway narrowing, or both. Low attenuation areas (LAA) on computed tomography (CT) have been shown to represent macroscopic or microscopic emphysema, or both. However CT has not been used to quantify the airway abnormalities in smokers with or without airflow obstruction. In this study, we used CT to evaluate both emphysema and airway wall thickening in 114 smokers. The CT measurements revealed that a decreased FEV(1) (%predicted) is associated with an increase of airway wall area and an increase of emphysema. Although both airway wall thickening and emphysema (LAA) correlated with measurements of lung function, stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the combination of airway and emphysema measurements improved the estimate of pulmonary function test abnormalities. We conclude that both CT measurements of airway dimensions and emphysema are useful and complementary in the evaluation of the lung of smokers.},

	abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) has shown that emphysema is more extensive in the inner (core) region than in the outer (rind) region of the lung. It has been suggested that the concentration of emphysematous lesions in the outer rind leads to a better outcome following lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) because these regions tend to be more surgically accessible. The present study used a recently described, computer-based CT scan analysis to quantify severe emphysema (lung inflation > 10.2 ml gas/g tissue), mild/moderate emphysema (lung inflation = 10.2 to 6.0 ml gas/g tissue), and normal lung tissue (lung inflation < 6.0 ml gas/g tissue) present in the core and rind of the lung in 21 LVRS patients. The results show that the quantification of severe emphysema independently predicts change in maximal exercise response and FEV(1). We conclude that a greater extent of severe emphysema in the rind of the upper lung predicts greater benefit from LVRS because it identifies the lesions most accessible to removal by LVRS.},

We compared different density masks, mean lung attenuation, visual assessment of emphysema and the pathologic grade of emphysema in 28 patients undergoing lung resection for tumor. In each patient, a single representative CT image was compared with corresponding pathologic specimens of tissue. There was good correlation between the extent of emphysema as assessed by the density mask and the pathologic grade of emphysema. The optimal attenuation level to define areas of emphysema may vary in different scanners, but, once determined for a particular scanner, the density mask accurately assesses the extent of emphysema and eliminates interobserver and intraobserver variability. It has the added advantage of determining the exact percentage of lung parenchyma showing changes consistent with emphysema.},

	abstract = {Thirty-eight patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy for carcinoma had preoperative computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Twenty-seven had both 1.5 mm and 10 mm collimation scans, and eleven had 10 mm collimation images only. These images were analyzed for the extent and severity of emphysema, and the analysis compared to the pathologic findings in the corresponding transverse slice of lung. The latter was graded by a modification of a panel of standards and by a grid system numerically expressing extent and severity. The grid system is theoretically superior to the panel of standards because it allows better quantitation of early emphysema and, contrary to the set of standards, is designed to analyze transverse CT images and corresponding pathologic slices. There was good correlation between the CT score and the pathologic score using the panel of standards (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) but a lower correlation with the grid system (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001). The correlation improved slightly with 1.5 as compared to 10 mm collimation scans. Close comparison between the CT and grid scores showed that CT was sensitive in demonstrating early distal acinar and irregular emphysema. However, CT consistently underestimated the extent of centriacinar and panacinar emphysema because most lesions less than 0.5 cm in diameter were missed. We conclude that CT is insensitive in detecting the earliest lesions of emphysema.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to determine hyperpolarized helium 3 (HHe) magnetic resonance (MR) findings of the lung in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared with healthy subjects and determine whether HHe MR can detect changes after bronchodilator therapy or mechanical airway mucus clearance treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one subjects, 16 healthy volunteers and 15 patients with CF, underwent HHe lung ventilation MR imaging and spirometry at baseline. Eight patients with CF then were treated with nebulized albuterol, after which a follow-up HHe MR scan was obtained. Subsequently, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (DNase) treatment and chest physical therapy were performed in these eight subjects, followed by a third HHe MR scan. For each MR study, the number of ventilation defects was scored by a human reader.
RESULTS: Patients with CF had significantly more HHe MR ventilation defects per image than healthy subjects (mean, 8.2 defects in patients with CF vs 1.6 defects in healthy subjects; P < .05). Even the four subjects with CF with a normal forced expiratory volume in 1 second had significantly more ventilation defects than healthy subjects (mean, 6.5 defects in these patients with CF; P = .0002). After treatment with albuterol, there was a small, but statistically significant, decrease in number of ventilation defects (mean, 9.6-8.0 defects; P = .025). After DNase and chest physical therapy, there was a trend toward increasing ventilation defects (mean, 8.3 defects; P = .096), but with a residual net improvement relative to baseline.
CONCLUSION: In patients with CF, HHe MR ventilation defects correlate with spirometry, change with treatment, and are elevated in number in patients with CF with normal spirometry results. Thus, HHe MR appears to possess many of the characteristics required of a biomarker for pulmonary CF and may be useful in the evaluation of CF pulmonary disease severity or progression.},

@article{McNitt-Gray:1997aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Our goal was to develop a protocol and image-processing methods to quantitate both bronchial and lung attenuation changes in patients imaged with helical high-resolution CT (HRCT).
METHOD: Human subjects underwent helical HRCT at two suspended breath-hold conditions, functional residual capacity and residual volume, at baseline and following methacholine-induced bronchoprovocation. A semiautomated contouring program was used to define anatomically like bronchi and axial lung sections from the different physiologic sequences, from which automated measurements of area, shape, and attenuation were made. Because the gray level threshold for contouring directly affects the measured area of an anatomic structure, two types of evaluation studies were performed. These included in vivo measurements using baseline parameters of human subjects as the standard of reference and in vitro measurements of a CT phantom designed to simulate the air-soft tissue interfaces of bronchi.
RESULTS: Phantom tests showed that the minimum difference between actual and measured areas of holes occurred at a threshold of -500 HU. The smallest diameter holes were most sensitive to changes in threshold value. However, although absolute area measurements of both simulated and human bronchi varied with threshold level, the percent changes in airway areas between baseline and bronchoprovocation sequences were relatively stable at any given threshold.
CONCLUSION: These image-processing tools provide reproducible measurements of area as well as attenuation characteristics of pulmonary structures and may offer insights into the practical use of functional imaging in evaluating conditions of airflow obstruction.},

Eight patients with stable CF prospectively underwent 3He MRI, HRCT, and spirometry within 1 week. Three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo sequence was used during an 18-s breath-hold following inhalation of hyperpolarized 3He. Each lung was divided into six zones; 3He MRI was scored as percentage ventilation per lung zone. HRCT was scored using a modified Bhalla scoring system. Univariate (Spearman rank) and multivariate correlations were performed between 3He MRI, HRCT, and spirometry. Results are expressed as mean+/-SD (range). Spirometry is expressed as percent predicted. There were four men and four women, mean age = 31.9+/-9 (20-46). Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV)1 = 52%+/-29 (27-93). Mean 3He MRI score = 74%+/-25 (55-100). Mean HRCT score = 48.8+/-24 (13.5-83). The correlation between 3He MRI and HRCT was strong (R = +/-0.89, p < 0.001). Bronchiectasis was the only independent predictor of 3He MRI; 3He MRI correlated better with FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) (R = 0.86 and 0.93, p < 0.01, respectively) than HRCT (R = +/-0.72 and +/-0.81, p < 0.05, respectively).

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate the effects of radiation dose and section thickness on quantitative multidetector computed tomographic (CT) indexes of pulmonary emphysema.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Seventy patients (49 men, 21 women; age range, 38-79 years) referred for surgical resection of a lung tumor underwent multidetector CT with 4 x 1-mm collimation, 120 kVp, and 20 and 120 effective mAs. At each radiation dose, 1.25-, 5.0-, and 10.0-mm-thick sections were reconstructed at 10-mm intervals. From scans of the lobe or whole lung to be resected, relative areas (RAs) of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than nine thresholds and eight percentiles of the distribution of attenuation coefficients were compared with the histopathologic extent of emphysema, which was measured microscopically--by using the corrected mean interwall distance (MIWD) and the corrected mean perimeter (MP)--and macroscopically. Correlations between the data obtained by using attenuation thresholds and percentiles and the parameters macroscopic extent of emphysema, MIWD, and MP were investigated by using Spearman coefficients.
RESULTS: The 1st percentile (r range, -0.394 to -0.675; P < .001) and attenuation coefficients of -980, -970, and -960 HU (r range, 0.478-0.664; P < .001) yielded the strongest correlations with macroscopic extent, MIWD, and MP, regardless of radiation dose or section thickness. The effects of radiation dose and section thickness on RAs of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than -960 HU (P = .007 and P < .001, respectively) and lower than -970 HU (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively) were significant. The effect of section thickness on the 1st percentile was significant (P < .001), whereas the effect of dose was not (P = .910).
CONCLUSION: At CT quantification of pulmonary emphysema, the tube current-time product can be reduced to 20 mAs, but both tube current-time product and section thickness should be kept constant in follow-up examinations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate regional airways obstruction in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with quantitative analysis of dynamic hyperpolarized (HP) (3)He MRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic radial projection MRI of HP (3)He gas was used to study respiratory dynamics in a group of eight children with CF. Signal kinetics in a total of seven regions of interest (ROIs; three in each lung, and one in the trachea) were compared with the results of spirometric pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The tracheal signal intensity was used as a form of "input function" to normalize for input flow effects.
RESULTS: A pattern of low flow rate in the upper lobes was observed. When the flow measurements from the peripheral ROIs were averaged to obtain an index of flow in the peripheral lung, a good correlation was found (P = 3.74 x 10(-5)) with the forced expired volume in one second (FEV1).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a quantitative measurement of localized airways obstruction in the early stages of CF may be obtained from dynamic (3)He MRI by using the slope of the signal rise as a measure of air flow into the peripheral lung. This study also demonstrates that children can cooperate well with the (3)He MRI technique.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Voxel-wise displacement vector field maps were generated between end-inspiratory and end-expiratory coronal thoracic MR images on normal mice (N = 5) to analyze the magnitude and direction of parenchymal motion in the segmented regions. The analysis was repeated before and after short-term exposure to hypoxia to demonstrate the effect of hypoxia on the respiratory motion in transgenic (Tg) mice with sickle cell disease (SCD) (N = 4).
RESULTS: Normal mice revealed that the right and left lungs moved symmetrically but that there was greater movement in the lower regions than in the upper regions. Calculated strain was uniform in the entire lung. In the Tg mice, the pulmonary motion before hypoxia was similar to that observed in the normal mice. Upon exposure to hypoxia, the displacement magnitude reduced and the direction of motion in some areas became distorted.
CONCLUSION: MR quantification of pulmonary motion was feasible in mice and the principle that the method could detect mechanical abnormalities due to pathologic changes was proven. Quantification of pulmonary motion has the potential to lead to earlier disease diagnosis and better monitoring of disease treatments.},

Interviews were conducted with memory clinic lead physicians (n = 16).Statistical analysis was done to assess differences between family physician ratings and geriatric specialist ratings related to the capacity for managing complex chronic geriatric conditions, the role of interprofessional collaboration within primary care, and funding and staffing to support geriatric care. Results from both study methods were compared to identify common findings.
MAIN FINDINGS: Results indicate overall support for expanding the memory clinic model to integrate care for other complex conditions. However, the current primary care structure is challenged to support optimal management of patients with multiple comorbidities, particularly as related to limited funding and staffing resources. Structured training, interprofessional teams, and an active role of geriatric specialists within primary care were identified as important facilitators.
CONCLUSION: The memory clinic model, as applied to other complex chronic geriatric conditions, has the potential to build capacity for high-quality primary care, improve health outcomes,promote efficient use of health care resources, and reduce healthcare costs.},

	abstract = {Segmentation of pulmonary X-ray computed tomography (CT) images is a precursor to most pulmonary image analysis applications. This paper presents a fully automatic method for identifying the lungs in three-dimensional (3-D) pulmonary X-ray CT images. The method has three main steps. First, the lung region is extracted from the CT images by gray-level thresholding. Then, the left and right lungs are separated by identifying the anterior and posterior junctions by dynamic programming. Finally, a sequence of morphological operations is used to smooth the irregular boundary along the mediastinum in order to obtain results consistent with those obtained by manual analysis, in which only the most central pulmonary arteries are excluded from the lung region. The method has been tested by processing 3-D CT data sets from eight normal subjects, each imaged three times at biweekly intervals with lungs at 90% vital capacity. We present results by comparing our automatic method to manually traced borders from two image analysts. Averaged over all volumes, the root mean square difference between the computer and human analysis is 0.8 pixels (0.54 mm). The mean intrasubject change in tissue content over the three scans was 2.75% +/- 2.29% (mean +/- standard deviation).},

	abstract = {With advances in multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT), it is now possible to image the lung in 10 s or less and accurately extract the lungs, lobes, and airway tree to the fifth- through seventh-generation bronchi and to regionally characterize lung density, texture, ventilation, and perfusion. These methods are now being used to phenotype the lung in health and disease and to gain insights into the etiology of pathologic processes. This article outlines the application of these methodologies with specific emphasis on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We demonstrate the use of our methods for assessing regional ventilation and perfusion and demonstrate early data that show, in a sheep model, a regionally intact hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor (HPV) response with an apparent inhibition of HPV regionally in the presence of inflammation. We present the hypothesis that, in subjects with pulmonary emphysema, one major contributing factor leading to parenchymal destruction is the lack of a regional blunting of HPV when the regional hypoxia is related to regional inflammatory events (bronchiolitis or alveolar flooding). If maintaining adequate blood flow to inflamed lung regions is critical to the nondestructive resolution of inflammatory events, the pathologic condition whereby HPV is sustained in regions of inflammation would likely have its greatest effect in the lung apices where blood flow is already reduced in the upright body posture.},

	abstract = {The lungs are highly elastic organs, composed of a variety of structures: vasculature, airways and parenchyma. The unique mechanical properties of each of these structures form the composite material of the lung. Numerous pulmonary diseases affect these material properties. Clinically, these structural changes cannot be directly quantified. However, medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to observe lung morphology. It would be helpful to be able to correlate regional morphological changes with changes in pulmonary function. We present an approach toward the quantification of pulmonary deformation via non-rigid registration of serial MR images of the lung using the variational framework implemented in the Insight toolkit. Conventional registration methods, as exemplified by a finite element implementation of the classic elastic matching technique, are shown to perform well over a set of vascular landmarks in the measurement of lung motion. This performance is maintained in an augmented system, which combines inhomogeneous material properties with the use of domain discretizations tailored to reflect the apparent geometry within the image and to reduce background effects. These adaptations lay the groundwork for biomechanical modeling of the lung using the finite element method.},

	abstract = {We used a computerized microscopic image analysis system to directly measure the surface area of distal air spaces in methacrylate-embedded blocks randomly selected from inflation-fixed lobes that were resected from 45 patients as treatment of their peripheral lung tumors. In 28 of these patients, a preoperative computer tomography (CT) scan, at 6 and 10 cm below the sternal notch, was used to generate frequency histograms of CT numbers (measured as EMI units), a measure of lung density, in pixels from the lung or lobe that was subsequently resected. A similar CT number histogram was also derived from the lateral two fifths of the area of lobe/lung that was to be resected. The EMI unit that defined the lowest fifth percentile of this latter histogram correlated (n = 28, r = -0.77, p less than 0.001) with the mean value of the surface area of the walls of distal airspaces per unit lung volume (AWUV) in the five 1 mm x 1 mm microscopic fields with the lowest AWUV values, out of the 20 to 35 such fields examined in each patient. In the 34 of the 45 patients in whom we also measured volume-corrected diffusing capacity (DLCO/VA), this also correlated (n = 34, r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) with this value of AWUV, which measures the surface area of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles--reflecting an increase in airspace size, a defining characteristic of emphysema. However, a low DLCO/VA is nonspecific, whereas an abnormally low regional lung density is more likely to be specific for emphysema. In addition, highlighting those pixels of the CT display with low CT numbers (i.e., EMI units -500 [air] to -450, where zero = water) can locate areas of macroscopic emphysema, as shown by subsequent pathologic examination. Thus the quantitative CT scan can diagnose, quantitate, and locate mild to moderate emphysema, in humans, in life, noninvasively.},

@article{Gee:2003aa,
	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate a method for quantifying lung motion from the registration of successive images in serial magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions during normal respiration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates of pulmonary motion were obtained by summing the normalized cross-correlation over serially acquired lung images to identify corresponding locations between the images. The estimated motions were modeled as deformations of an elastic body and thus reflect to a first order approximation the true physical behavior of lung parenchyma. The Lagrangian strain, derived from the calculated motion fields, were used to quantify the tissue deformation induced in the lung over the serial acquisition.
RESULTS: The method was validated on a magnetic resonance imaging study, for which breath-hold images were acquired of a healthy volunteer at different phases of the respiratory cycle. Regional parenchymal strain was observed to be oriented toward the pulmonary hilum, with strain magnitude maximal at the midcycle of the expiratory phase.
CONCLUSION: In vivo magnetic resonance imaging quantification of lung motion holds the potential of providing a new diagnostic dimension in the assessment of pulmonary function, augmenting the information provided by studies of ventilation and perfusion.},

The HRCT scans of 156 patients obtained at full inspiratory and expiratory position were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were divided into four groups according to lung function tests: normal subjects ( n=47); obstructive ( n=74); restrictive ( n=19); or mixed ventilatory impairment ( n=16). Mean lung density (MLD) was correlated with cross-sectional area of the lung (CSA(L)), cross-sectional area of the trachea (CSA(T)) and diameter of main-stem bronchi (D(B)). The CSA(L) was correlated with CSA(T) and D(B). MLD correlated with CSA(L) in normal subjects ( r=-0.66, p<0.0001) and patients with obstructive ( r=-0.62, p<0.0001), restrictive ( r=-0.83, p<0.0001) and mixed ventilatory impairment ( r=-0.86, p<0.0001). The MLD correlated with CSA(T) in the control group ( r=-0.50, p<0.0001) and in patients with obstructive lung impairment ( r-0.27, p<0.05). In patients with normal lung function a correlation between MLD and D(B) was found ( r=-0.52, p<0.0001). CSA(L) and CSA(T) correlated in the control group ( r=0.67, p<0.0001) and in patients with obstructive lung disease ( r=0.51, p<0.0001). The CSA(L) and D(B) correlated in the control group ( r=0.42, p<0.0001) and in patients with obstructive lung disease ( r=0.24, p<0.05). Correlations for patients with restrictive and mixed lung disease were constantly lower. Dependencies between central and peripheral airway dimensions and lung parenchyma are demonstrated by HRCT. Best correlations are observed in normal subjects and patients with obstructive lung disease. Based on these findings we postulate that the dependencies are the result of air-flow and pressure patterns.},

@article{Dougherty:2006aa,
	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Serial CT lung studies are difficult to compare due to misregistration between image sets. An optical flow method (OFM) was adapted for use on CT lung images to register images and visualize changes between studies. Three applications were investigated: lung nodule assessment; evaluation of pulmonary enhancement; and functional changes due to air trapping.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From an initial clinical study, a follow-up study was created by digitally manipulating the images to simulate patient positioning errors and nodule growth. Nodule growth was measured from the temporal subtraction of registered images. In application to the assessment of pulmonary enhancement, pre and postcontrast images from a patient with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) were registered. A map of the perfused blood volume was computed from the ratio of aligned lung volumes. Functional changes in the lung were demonstrated using images from a patient with air trapping. End-inspiratory and end-expiratory volumes were aligned and displacement fields estimated using the OFM. Principal strains were computed from the displacement fields.
RESULTS: All image volumes were aligned with at least 0.95 correlation. OFM estimates of displacement showed excellent agreement with the prescribed displacements with 0.33 pixel RMS error. Nodule growth was evident in the presence of significant positioning errors. In the PE case, enhancement ratios indicated a hypoperfused area consistent with an occlusive hypodense filling defect. For the air trapping case, a strain map showed functional changes along the interface of the air trap.
CONCLUSIONS: The OFM can facilitate the detection and quantification of changes between serial CT lung studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether focal changes of airflow obstruction within the lungs of patients with asthma vary or are fixed in location with time or repeated bronchoconstriction. With hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance (H(3)HeMR) imaging, the airspaces are depicted and focal areas of airflow obstruction are shown as "ventilation defects."
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regional changes of airflow obstruction with time and repeated bronchoconstriction.
METHODS: H(3)HeMR and spirometry were performed before (pre) and immediately after (post) methacholine challenge in 10 young patients with asthma on 2 days that were 7-476 days (mean, 185.3 +/- 37.2 days) apart. Pair-wise image comparisons were performed to determine the change in location of ventilation defects within the lung and their change in size.
RESULTS: When comparing premethacholine versus premethacholine and postmethacholine versus post-methacholine images of the 2 days, 41% +/- 10% and 69% +/- 5% (P = .017) of defects, respectively, were in the same location, and of those, 69% +/- 12% and 43% +/- 5% (P = .022), respectively, did not change size. Comparing premethacholine versus postmethacholine images, 58% +/- 9% of defects were in the same location on day 1 and 73% +/- 7% (P = .088) on day 2. On both days, the percent increase in defect number from premethacholine to postmethacholine was much greater than the percent decrease in spirometric values (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Many of the ventilation defects persisted or recurred in the same location with time or repeated bronchoconstriction, suggesting that the regional changes of airflow obstruction are relatively fixed within the lung.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings give new insight into the regional airflow variability within the lungs of patients with asthma.},

Hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI (H(3)HeMR) is a new technique in which the airspaces are visualized, depicting regions with airflow obstruction as "ventilation defects." The objective of this study was to compare the extent of H(3)HeMR ventilation defects with measures of asthma severity and spirometry.
METHODS: Patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma and normal control subjects underwent H(3)HeMR. For each person, the number and size of ventilation defects were scored and the average number of ventilation defects per slice (VDS) was calculated. The correlations of the imaging findings with measures of asthma severity and spirometry were determined.
RESULTS: There were 58 patients with asthma (mild-intermittent, n = 13; mild-persistent, n = 13; moderate-persistent, n = 20; and severe-persistent, n = 12) and 18 control subjects. Mean +/- SE VDS for asthmatics was significantly greater than for control subjects (0.99 +/- 0.15 vs 0.26 +/- 0.22, p = 0.004). Among asthmatics, VDS was significantly higher for the group with moderate-persistent and severe-persistent disease than for the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (1.37 +/- 0.24 vs 0.53 +/- 0.12, p < 0.001). VDS correlated significantly with FEV(1)/FVC (r = - 0.51, p = 0.002), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% from the beginning of FVC (FEF(25-75%)) percentage of predicted for height, sex, and race (%predicted) [r = - 0.50, p = 0.001], and FEV(1) %predicted (r = - 0.40, p = 0.002), but not with FVC %predicted (r = - 0.26, p = 0.057) and peak expiratory flow %predicted (r = - 0.16, p = 0.231). Many asthmatics had an elevated VDS, but their spirometric indexes, except FEF(25%-75%), were normal. Most ventilation defects were < 3 cm in size for all asthmatics. In the group of patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, there were more defects > or =3 cm than in the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (p = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: Regional changes of airflow obstruction in asthmatics depicted by H(3)HeMR correlate with measures of asthma severity and spirometry.},

	abstract = {Quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT) has been combined with a stereologically based histologic analysis of lung structure to assess regional lung inflation and the structural features of the lung parenchyma. In this study, CT measurements of lung inflation were compared with histologic estimates of surface area in order to develop prediction equations that allow lung surface to volume ratio and surface area to be predicted from an analysis of the CT scan. The results show that mild emphysema is associated with an increase in lung volume and a reduction in surface to volume ratio, whereas surface area and tissue weight were only decreased in severe disease. The CT predicted surface to volume ratio correlated with histology, and both predicted and measured surface areas correlated with the diffusing capacity.

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex genetic disorder in which environmental factors, such as tobacco smoke, interact with genetic susceptibility to cause disease. Airway obstruction in COPD is due to an exaggerated inflammatory response that ultimately destroys the lung parenchyma (emphysema) and increases airway resistance by remodeling the airway wall. Until recently, assessment of these disease processes required the examination of resected tissue. However, computed tomography (CT) now allows researchers to measure the structure of the lung parenchyma and airway wall without having to remove the tissue. This review describes some of the new CT techniques for quantitative assessment of lung structure. These techniques are extremely important to study the pathogenesis of COPD as well as differentiate patients with predominantly emphysema disease from those with airway wall remodeling, and to assess the effects of therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {The total and regional lung volumes were estimated from computed tomography (CT), and the pleural pressure gradient was determined by using the milliliters of gas per gram of tissue estimated from the X-ray attenuation values and the pressure-volume curve of the lung. The data show that CT accurately estimated the volume of the resected lobe but overestimated its weight by 24 +/- 19%. The volume of gas per gram of tissue was less in the gravity-dependent regions due to a pleural pressure gradient of 0.24 +/- 0.08 cmH2O/cm of descent in the thorax. The proportion of tissue to air obtained with CT was similar to that obtained by quantitative histology. We conclude that the CT scan can be used to estimate total and regional lung volumes and that measurements of the proportions of tissue and air within the thorax by CT can be used in conjunction with quantitative histology to evaluate lung structure.},

	abstract = {Assessing the quality of motion estimation in the lung remains challenging. We approach the problem by imaging isolated porcine lungs within an artificial thorax with four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT). Respiratory kinematics are estimated via pairwise non-rigid registration using different metrics and image resolutions. Landmarks are manually identified on the images and used to assess accuracy by comparing known displacements to the registration-derived displacements. We find that motion quantitation becomes less precise as the inflation interval between images increases. In addition, its sensitivity to image resolution varies anatomically. Mutual information and cross-correlation perform similarly, while mean squares is significantly poorer. However, none of the metrics compensate for the difficulty of registering over a large inflation interval. We intend to use the results of these experiments to more effectively and efficiently quantify pulmonary kinematics in future, and to explore additional parameter combinations.},

	abstract = {Following B.B. Mandelbrot's fractal theory (1982), it was found that the fractal dimension could be obtained in medical images by the concept of fractional Brownian motion. An estimation concept for determination of the fractal dimension based upon the concept of fractional Brownian motion is discussed. Two applications are found: (1) classification; (2) edge enhancement and detection. For the purpose of classification, a normalized fractional Brownian motion feature vector is defined from this estimation concept. It represented the normalized average absolute intensity difference of pixel pairs on a surface of different scales. The feature vector uses relatively few data items to represent the statistical characteristics of the medial image surface and is invariant to linear intensity transformation. For edge enhancement and detection application, a transformed image is obtained by calculating the fractal dimension of each pixel over the whole medical image. The fractal dimension value of each pixel is obtained by calculating the fractal dimension of 7x7 pixel block centered on this pixel.},

	abstract = {The lungs exchange air with the external environment via the pulmonary airways. Computed tomography (CT) scanning can be used to obtain detailed images of the pulmonary anatomy, including the airways. These images have been used to measure airway geometry, study airway reactivity, and guide surgical interventions. Prior to these applications, airway segmentation can be used to identify the airway lumen in the CT images. Airway tree segmentation can be performed manually by an image analyst, but the complexity of the tree makes manual segmentation tedious and extremely time-consuming. We describe a fully automatic technique for segmenting the airway tree in three-dimensional (3-D) CT images of the thorax. We use grayscale morphological reconstruction to identify candidate airways on CT slices and then reconstruct a connected 3-D airway tree. After segmentation, we estimate airway branchpoints based on connectivity changes in the reconstructed tree. Compared to manual analysis on 3-mm-thick electron-beam CT images, the automatic approach has an overall airway branch detection sensitivity of approximately 73%.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

	abstract = {The goal of this research is to promote variational methods for anatomical averaging that operate within the space of the underlying image registration problem. This approach is effective when using the large deformation viscous framework, where linear averaging is not valid, or in the elastic case. The theory behind this novel atlas building algorithm is similar to the traditional pairwise registration problem, but with single image forces replaced by average forces. These group forces drive an average transport ordinary differential equation allowing one to estimate the geodesic that moves an image toward the mean shape configuration. This model gives large deformation atlases that are optimal with respect to the shape manifold as defined by the data and the image registration assumptions. We use the techniques in the large deformation context here, but they also pertain to small deformation atlas construction. Furthermore, a natural, inherently inverse consistent image registration is gained for free, as is a tool for constant arc length geodesic shape interpolation. The geodesic atlas creation algorithm is quantitatively compared to the Euclidean anatomical average to elucidate the need for optimized atlases. The procedures generate improved average representations of highly variable anatomy from distinct populations.},

Ventilation defects studied over time demonstrated no change in appearance over 30-60 minutes. One asthmatic subject was studied twice in a three-week period and had ventilation defects which resolved and appeared in that time. This same subject was studied before and after bronchodilator therapy, and all ventilation defects resolved after therapy.

Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all subregions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements.

This technique transfers segmentations from expert-labeled images, called atlases, to a novel image using deformable image registration. Errors produced by label transfer are further reduced by label fusion that combines the results produced by all atlases into a consensus solution. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity is a simple and highly effective label fusion technique. However, one limitation of most weighted voting methods is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this problem, we recently developed the joint label fusion technique and the corrective learning technique, which won the first place of the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge and was one of the top performers in 2013 MICCAI Segmentation: Algorithms, Theory and Applications (SATA) challenge. To make our techniques more accessible to the scientific research community, we describe an Insight-Toolkit based open source implementation of our label fusion methods. Our implementation extends our methods to work with multi-modality imaging data and is more suitable for segmentation problems with multiple labels. We demonstrate the usage of our tools through applying them to the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge brain image dataset and the 2013 SATA challenge canine leg image dataset. We report the best results on these two datasets so far.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the impact of template choice on template-based segmentation of the hippocampus in epilepsy. Four dataset-specific strategies are quantitatively contrasted: the "closest to average" individual template, the average shape version of the closest to average template, a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS). The cross-correlation similarity metric drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that, with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy, optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts the study of diseased hippocampi.},

	abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

@article{Tustison:2014ad,
	abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design. Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps each subject's image to a representative template before performing statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference (SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size--an experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms that are less sensitive to this bias.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gliomas remain difficult to treat, in part, due to our inability to accurately delineate the margins of the tumor. The goal of our study was to evaluate if a combination of advanced MR imaging techniques and a multimodal imaging model could be used to predict tumor infiltration in patients with diffuse gliomas.
METHODS: Institutional review board approval and written consent were obtained. This prospective pilot study enrolled patients undergoing stereotactic biopsy for a suspected de novo glioma. Stereotactic biopsy coordinates were coregistered with multiple standard and advanced neuroimaging sequences in 10 patients. Objective imaging values were assigned to the biopsy sites for each of the imaging sequences. A principal component analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the imaging dataset without losing important information. A univariate analysis was performed to identify the statistically relevant principal components. Finally, a multivariate analysis was used to build the final model describing nuclear density.
RESULTS: A univariate analysis identified three principal components as being linearly associated with the observed nuclear density (p values 0.021, 0.016, and 0.046, respectively). These three principal component composite scores are predominantly comprised of DTI (mean diffusivity or average diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy) and PWI data (rMTT, Ktrans). The p value of the model was <0.001. The correlation between the predicted and observed nuclear density was 0.75.
CONCLUSION: A multi-input, single output imaging model may predict the extent of glioma invasion with significant correlation with histopathology.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and validate a method for acquiring helium-3 ((3) He) and proton ((1) H) three-dimensional (3D) image sets of the human lung with isotropic spatial resolution within a 10-s breath-hold by using compressed sensing (CS) acceleration, and to assess the fidelity of undersampled images compared with fully sampled images.
METHODS: The undersampling scheme for CS acceleration was optimized and tested using (3) He ventilation data. Rapid 3D acquisition of both (3) He and (1) H data during one breath-hold was then implemented, based on a balanced steady-state free-precession pulse sequence, by random undersampling of k-space with reconstruction by means of minimizing the L1 norm and total variance. CS-reconstruction fidelity was evaluated quantitatively by comparing fully sampled and retrospectively undersampled image sets.
RESULTS: Helium-3 and (1) H 3D image sets of the lung with isotropic 3.9-mm resolution were acquired during a single breath-hold in 12 s and 8 s using acceleration factors of 2 and 3, respectively. Comparison of fully sampled and retrospectively undersampled (3) He and (1) H images yielded mean absolute errors <10% and structural similarity indices >0.9.
CONCLUSION: By randomly undersampling k-space and using CS reconstruction, high-quality (3) He and (1) H 3D image sets with isotropic 3.9-mm resolution can be acquired within an 8-s breath-hold. Magn Reson Med, 2014. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Strain was measured through registration of 300 μm isotropic resolution images. Excellent registration accuracy was achieved, with 94% and 65% overlap of disc volume and lamellae compared to manual segmentation, and an average Hausdorff, a measure of distance error, of 0.03 and 0.12 mm for disc volume and lamellae boundaries, respectively. Strain maps enabled qualitative visualization and quantitative regional annulus fibrosus (AF) strain analysis. Axial and circumferential strains were highest in the lateral AF and lowest in the anterior and posterior AF. Radial strains were lowest in the lateral AF, but highly variable. Overall, this study provided new methods that will be valuable in the design and evaluation surgical procedures and therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the corticospinal tract (CST) is a reliable surrogate for intraoperative macrostimulation through the deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads. The authors hypothesized that the distance on MRI from the DBS lead to the CST as determined by DTI would correlate with intraoperative motor thresholds from macrostimulations through the same DBS lead.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed pre- and postoperative MRI studies and intraoperative macrostimulation recordings in 17 patients with Parkinson disease (PD) treated by DBS stimulation. Preoperative DTI tractography of the CST was coregistered with postoperative MRI studies showing the position of the DBS leads. The shortest distance and the angle from each contact of each DBS lead to the CST was automatically calculated using software-based analysis. The distance measurements calculated for each contact were evaluated with respect to the intraoperative voltage thresholds that elicited a motor response at each contact.
RESULTS: There was a nonsignificant trend for voltage thresholds to increase when the distances between the DBS leads and the CST increased. There was a significant correlation between the angle and the voltage, but the correlation was weak (coefficient of correlation [R] = 0.36).
CONCLUSIONS: Caution needs to be exercised when using DTI tractography information to guide DBS lead placement in patients with PD. Further studies are needed to compare DTI tractography measurements with other approaches such as microelectrode recordings and conventional intraoperative MRI-guided placement of DBS leads.},

	abstract = {Precise focusing is essential for transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (TcMRgFUS) to minimize collateral damage to non-diseased tissues and to achieve temperatures capable of inducing coagulative necrosis at acceptable power deposition levels. CT is usually used for this refocusing but requires a separate study (CT) ahead of the TcMRgFUS procedure. The goal of this study was to determine whether MRI using an appropriate sequence would be a viable alternative to CT for planning ultrasound refocusing in TcMRgFUS. We tested three MRI pulse sequences (3D T1 weighted 3D volume interpolated breath hold examination (VIBE), proton density weighted 3D sampling perfection with applications optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution and 3D true fast imaging with steady state precision T2-weighted imaging) on patients who have already had a CT scan performed. We made detailed measurements of the calvarial structure based on the MRI data and compared those so-called 'virtual CT' to detailed measurements of the calvarial structure based on the CT data, used as a reference standard. We then loaded both standard and virtual CT in a TcMRgFUS device and compared the calculated phase correction values, as well as the temperature elevation in a phantom. A series of Bland-Altman measurement agreement analyses showed T1 3D VIBE as the optimal MRI sequence, with respect to minimizing the measurement discrepancy between the MRI derived total skull thickness measurement and the CT derived total skull thickness measurement (mean measurement discrepancy: 0.025; 95% CL (-0.22-0.27); p = 0.825). The T1-weighted sequence was also optimal in estimating skull CT density and skull layer thickness. The mean difference between the phase shifts calculated with the standard CT and the virtual CT reconstructed from the T1 dataset was 0.08 $\pm$ 1.2 rad on patients and 0.1 $\pm$ 0.9 rad on phantom. Compared to the real CT, the MR-based correction showed a 1 $\,^{\circ}$C drop on the maximum temperature elevation in the phantom (7% relative drop). Without any correction, the maximum temperature was down 6 $\,^{\circ}$C (43% relative drop). We have developed an approach that allows for a reconstruction of a virtual CT dataset from MRI to perform phase correction in TcMRgFUS.},

	abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

	abstract = {Non-uniform distribution of inspired gas within the lung, termed ventilation heterogeneity, is present in patients with even mild asthma. Current evidence strongly supports ventilation heterogeneity as a fundamental derangement of lung function in asthma that contributes per se to hypoxemia and airway hyper-responsiveness. An extreme example of ventilation heterogeneity is the identification by hyperpolarized gas MRI of lung regions with no ventilation, termed filling defects. Lung filling defects in patients with asthma can persist over time, increase in size with methacholine-induced bronchospasm and more likely are caused by obstruction of the peripheral and not the proximal airways. Ventilation heterogeneity can be quantified in the conducting and acinar lung zones with the multiple gas washout method, and in the acinar zone does not fully resolve following bronchodilator treatment in patients with asthma. In prospective studies, the degree of ventilation heterogeneity at baseline predicts airway hyper-responsiveness and response to corticosteroid dose titration. An important unanswered question is the relationship of airways inflammation to ventilation heterogeneity. In consideration of the importance of ventilation heterogeneity in its pathobiology, asthma is more a focal disorder with regional pathology akin to regional ileitis and not the generalized disorder of the airways as it has been viewed in the past.},

Furthermore, ITK(4) reduces the parameter optimization burden via principled heuristics that automatically set scaling across disparate parameter types (rotations vs. translations). A related approach also constrains steps sizes for gradient-based optimizers. The result is that tuning for different metrics and/or image pairs is rarely necessary allowing the researcher to more easily focus on design/comparison of registration strategies. In total, the ITK(4) contribution is intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices, will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate new work in image registration and also enable application level programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build. Finally, we contextualize this work with a reference registration evaluation study with application to pediatric brain labeling.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To use diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with essential tremor who were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound lesion inducement to identify the structural connectivity of the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus and determine how DT imaging changes correlated with tremor changes after lesion inducement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval, and with prospective informed consent, 15 patients with medication-refractory essential tremor were enrolled in a HIPAA-compliant pilot study and were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery targeting the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus contralateral to their dominant hand. Fourteen patients were ultimately included. DT MR imaging studies at 3.0 T were performed preoperatively and 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the procedure. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated from the DT imaging data sets for all time points in all patients. Voxels where FA consistently decreased over time were identified, and FA change in these voxels was correlated with clinical changes in tremor over the same period by using Pearson correlation.
RESULTS: Ipsilateral brain structures that showed prespecified negative correlation values of FA over time of -0.5 or less included the pre- and postcentral subcortical white matter in the hand knob area; the region of the corticospinal tract in the centrum semiovale, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and in the cerebral peduncle; the thalamus; the region of the red nucleus; the location of the central tegmental tract; and the region of the inferior olive. The contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle and bilateral portions of the superior vermis also showed persistent decrease in FA over time. There was strong correlation between decrease in FA and clinical improvement in hand tremor 3 months after lesion inducement (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: DT MR imaging after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy depicts changes in specific brain structures. The magnitude of the DT imaging changes after thalamic lesion inducement correlates with the degree of clinical improvement in essential tremor.},

	abstract = {Diffeomorphic mappings are central to image registration due largely to their topological properties and success in providing biologically plausible solutions to deformation and morphological estimation problems. Popular diffeomorphic image registration algorithms include those characterized by time-varying and constant velocity fields, and symmetrical considerations. Prior information in the form of regularization is used to enforce transform plausibility taking the form of physics-based constraints or through some approximation thereof, e.g., Gaussian smoothing of the vector fields [a la Thirion's Demons (Thirion, 1998)]. In the context of the original Demons' framework, the so-called directly manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) (Tustison et al., 2009) can be viewed as a smoothing alternative in which explicit regularization is achieved through fast B-spline approximation. This characterization can be used to provide B-spline "flavored" diffeomorphic image registration solutions with several advantages. Implementation is open source and available through the Insight Toolkit and our Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) repository. A thorough comparative evaluation with the well-known SyN algorithm (Avants et al., 2008), implemented within the same framework, and its B-spline analog is performed using open labeled brain data and open source evaluation tools.},

	abstract = {Segmenting and quantifying gliomas from MRI is an important task for diagnosis, planning intervention, and for tracking tumor changes over time. However, this task is complicated by the lack of prior knowledge concerning tumor location, spatial extent, shape, possible displacement of normal tissue, and intensity signature. To accommodate such complications, we introduce a framework for supervised segmentation based on multiple modality intensity, geometry, and asymmetry feature sets. These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate excellent discriminative properties within this framework. We also gain performance by generating probability maps from random forest models and using these maps for a refining Markov random field regularized probabilistic segmentation. This strategy allows us to interface the supervised learning capabilities of the random forest model with regularized probabilistic segmentation using the recently developed ANTsR package-a comprehensive statistical and visualization interface between the popular Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the R statistical project. The reported algorithmic framework was the top-performing entry in the MICCAI 2013 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge. The challenge data were widely varying consisting of both high-grade and low-grade glioma tumor four-modality MRI from five different institutions. Average Dice overlap measures for the final algorithmic assessment were 0.87, 0.78, and 0.74 for "complete", "core", and "enhanced" tumor components, respectively.},

Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is a functional imaging method which allows for encoding of a grid of signal voids on cardiac MR images, providing a mechanism for noninvasive measurement of intramural tissue deformations, in vivo. We present a novel technique of employing a four-dimensional (4-D) B-spline model which permits concurrent determination of myocardial beads and myocardial strains. The method entails fitting the knot planes of the 4-D B-spline model for fixed times to a sequence of triplets of orthogonal sets of tag surfaces for all imaged volumetric frames within the constraints of the model's spatio-temporal internal energy. From a three-dimensional (3-D) displacement field, the corresponding long and short-axis Lagrangian normal, shear, and principal strain maps are produced. As an important byproduct, the points defined by the 3-D intersections of the triplets of orthogonal tag planes, which we refer to as myocardial beads, can easily be determined by our model. Displaying the beads as a movie loop allows for the visualization of the nonrigid movement of the left ventricle in 3-D.},

	abstract = {We present research in which both left and right ventricular deformation is estimated from tagged cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using volumetric deformable models constructed from nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The four model types considered and compared for the left ventricle include two Cartesian NURBS models--one with a cylindrical parameter assignment and one with a prolate spheroidal parameter assignment. The remaining two are non-Cartesian, i.e., prolate spheroidal and cylindrical each with their respective prolate spheroidal and cylindrical parameter assignment regimes. These choices were made based on the typical shape of the left ventricle. For each frame starting with end-diastole, a NURBS model is constructed by fitting two surfaces with the same parameterization to the corresponding set of epicardial and endocardial contours from which a volumetric model is created. Using normal displacements of the three sets of orthogonal tag planes as well as displacements of contour/tag line intersection points and tag plane intersection points, one can solve for the optimal homogeneous coordinates, in a weighted least squares sense, of the control points of the deformed NURBS model at end-diastole using quadratic programming. This allows for subsequent nonrigid registration of the biventricular model at end-diastole to all later time frames. After registration of the model to all later time points, the registered NURBS models are temporally lofted in order to create a comprehensive four-dimensional NURBS model. From the lofted model, we can extract three-dimensional myocardial deformation fields and corresponding Lagrangian and Eulerian strain maps which are local measures of nonrigid deformation. The results show that, in the case of simulated data, the quadratic Cartesian NURBS models with the cylindrical and prolate spheroidal parameter assignments outperform their counterparts in predicting normal strain. The decreased complexity associated with the Cartesian model with the cylindrical parameter assignment prompted its use for subsequent calculations. Lagrangian strains in three canine data, a normal human, and a patient with history of myocardial infarction are presented. Eulerian strains for the normal human data are also included.},

	abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically, these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline object describes the transformation of the image registration solution. Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution. The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation experimentation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces. Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces. Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic analysis was performed on three volunteers.
RESULTS: Tag lines in inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous 3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior.
CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged (3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

A variant of the traditional free-form deformation approach, known as directly manipulated free-form deformation, is used to model the transformation of the registration solution. We provide an overview of its open source implementation based on the Insight Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health. Characterization of the proposed framework includes comparison with other state of the art kernel-based methods and demonstration of its utility for lung registration via labeled point set representation of lung anatomy.},

This provides for a theoretical justification, based on the digital Jordan separation theorem, for digitally "gluing" evolved well-composed objects separated by well-composed curves or surfaces. Additionally, our framework can be extended to more relaxed topologically constrained algorithms based on multisimple points. For both methods this framework has the additional benefit of obviating the requirement for both a user-specified connectivity and a topologically-consistent marching cubes/squares algorithm in meshing the resulting segmentation.},

	abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

	abstract = {EMPIRE10 (Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image REgistration 2010) is a public platform for fair and meaningful comparison of registration algorithms which are applied to a database of intrapatient thoracic CT image pairs. Evaluation of nonrigid registration techniques is a nontrivial task. This is compounded by the fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the configuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website (http://empire10.isi.uu.nl). The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing. This paper details the organization of the challenge, the data and evaluation methods and the outcome of the initial launch with 20 algorithms. The gain in knowledge and future work are discussed.},

Current approaches to diagnosis and treatment assessment of lung disease commonly rely on pulmonary function testing. Such testing is limited to global measures of lung function, neglecting regional measurements, which are critical for early diagnosis and localization of disease. Increased accessibility to medical image acquisition strategies with high spatiotemporal resolution coupled with the development of sophisticated intensity-based and geometric registration techniques has resulted in the recent exploration of modeling pulmonary motion for calculating local measures of deformation. In this review, the authors provide a broad overview of such research efforts for the estimation of pulmonary deformation. This includes discussion of various techniques, current trends in validation approaches, and the public availability of software and data resources.},

@article{Yilmaz:2011aa,
	abstract = {In adult canines following major lung resection, the remaining lobes expand asymmetrically, associated with alveolar tissue regrowth, remodeling, and progressive functional compensation over many months. To permit noninvasive longitudinal assessment of regional growth and function, we performed serial high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) on six male dogs (∼9 mo old, 25.0 $\pm$ 4.5 kg, $\pm$SD) at 15 and 30 cmH(2)O transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) before resection (PRE) and 3 and 15 mo postresection (POST3 and POST15, respectively) of 65-70% of lung units. At POST3, lobar air volume increased 83-148% and tissue (including microvascular blood) volume 120-234% above PRE values without further changes at POST15. Lobar-specific compliance (Cs) increased 52-137% from PRE to POST3 and 28-79% from POST3 to POST15. Inflation-related parenchyma strain and shear were estimated by detailed registration of corresponding anatomical features at each Ptp. Within each lobe, regional displacement was most pronounced at the caudal region, whereas strain was pronounced in the periphery. Regional three-dimensional strain magnitudes increased heterogeneously from PRE to POST3, with further medial-lateral increases from POST3 to POST15. Lobar principal strains (PSs) were unchanged or modestly elevated postresection; changes in lobar maximum PS correlated inversely with changes in lobar air and tissue volumes. Lobar shear distortion increased in coronal and transverse planes at POST3 without further changes thereafter. These results establish a novel use of functional HRCT to map heterogeneous regional deformation during compensatory lung growth and illustrate a stimulus-response feedback loop whereby postresection mechanical stress initiates differential lobar regrowth and sustained remodeling, which in turn, relieves parenchyma stress and strain, resulting in progressive increases in lobar Cs and a delayed increase in whole lung Cs.},

@article{Tustison:2011aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an automated segmentation method to differentiate the ventilated lung volume on (3) He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational processing (CP) for each subject consisted of the following three essential steps: 1) inhomogeneity bias correction, 2) whole lung segmentation, and 3) subdivision of the lung segmentation into regions of similar ventilation. Evaluation consisted of two comparative analyses: i) comparison of the number of defects scored by two human readers in 43 subjects, and ii) simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) in 18 subjects in which the ventilation defects were manually segmented by four human readers.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the number of ventilation defects tabulated by CP and reader #1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.86), CP and reader #2 (ICC = 0.85), and between the two readers (ICC = 0.97). The STAPLE results from the second analysis yielded the following sensitivity/specificity numbers: CP (0.898/0.905), radiologist #1 (0.743/0.897), radiologist #2 (0.501/0.985), radiologist #3 (0.898/0.848), and the first author (0.600/0.984).
CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated method for quantifying the ventilated lung volume on (3) He MRI. The findings strongly indicate that our proposed algorithmic processing may be a reliable, automatic method for quantitating ventilation defects.},

@article{Barbosa:2011aa,
	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes are related to variable combinations of emphysema and small-airway disease, the latter manifested as air trapping (AT) on imaging. The investigators propose a method to extract AT information quantitatively from thoracic multi-detector row high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), validated by pulmonary function testing (PFT) correlation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent HRCT and PFT within a 3-day interval were retrospectively identified. Thin-section volumetric HRCT in inspiration and expiration was registered and analyzed using custom-made software. Nonaerated regions of lung were segmented through exclusion of voxels > -50 Hounsfield units (HU); emphysematous areas were segmented as voxels < -950 HU on inspiratory images. Small-airway AT volume (ATV) was segmented as regions of lung voxels whose attenuation values increased by less than a specified change threshold (set from 5 to 300 HU in 25-HU increments) between inspiration and expiration. Inspiratory and expiratory total segmented lung volumes, emphysema volume (EV), and ATV for each threshold were subsequently calculated and correlated with PFT parameters.
RESULTS: A strong positive correlation was obtained between total segmented lung volume in inspiration and total lung capacity (r = 0.83). A strong negative correlation (r = -0.80) was obtained between EV and the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity. Stronger negative correlation with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (r = -0.85) was demonstrated when ATV (threshold, 50 HU) was added to EV, indicating improved quantification of total AT to predict obstructive disease severity. A moderately strong positive correlation between ATV and residual volume was observed, with a maximum r value of 0.72 (threshold, 25 HU), greater than that between EV and residual volume (r = 0.58). The benefit of ATV quantification was greater in a subgroup of patients with negligible emphysema compared to patients with moderate to severe emphysema.
CONCLUSIONS: Small-airway AT segmentation in conjunction with emphysema segmentation through computer-assisted methodologies may provide better correlations with key PFT parameters, suggesting that the quantification of emphysema-related and small airway-related components of AT from thoracic HRCT has great potential to elucidate phenotypic differences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of various image-based metrics computed from thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) with data from pulmonary function testing (PFT) in characterizing interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with ILD and 11 with COPD had undergone both PFT and HRCT within 3 days. For each patient, 93 image-based metrics were computed, and their relationships with the 21 clinically used PFT parameters were analyzed using a minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance statistical framework. The first 20 features were selected among the total of 114 mixed image metrics and PFT values in the characterization of ILD and COPD.
RESULTS: Among the best-performing 20 features, 14 were image metrics, derived from attenuation histograms and texture descriptions. The highest relevance value computed from PFT parameters was 0.47, and the highest from image metrics was 0.52, given the theoretical bound as [0, 0.69]. The ILD or COPD classifier using the first four features achieved a 1.92% error rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Some image metrics are not only as good discriminators as PFT for the characterization of ILD and COPD but are also not redundant when PFT values are provided. Image metrics of attenuation histogram statistics and texture descriptions may be valuable for further investigation in computer-assisted diagnosis.},
